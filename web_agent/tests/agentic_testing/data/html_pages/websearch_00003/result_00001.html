        <h1>Withdrawals from age 55 onwards</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Key Information:</strong> You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards. Check how much you are eligible to withdraw via your Retirement Dashboard. You can make as many withdrawals as you like from your withdrawable savings, so there's no need to take everything out in one go.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Understanding CPF Withdrawal Rules</h2>
        
        <p>The Central Provident Fund (CPF) system is designed to help Singaporeans save for retirement, healthcare, and housing needs. One of the most common questions we receive is about the withdrawal age.</p>
        
        <div class="important-notice">
            <strong>Important:</strong> The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50. This age requirement has been consistent since 1987 and applies to all CPF members.
        </div>
        
        <h2>What Can You Withdraw at Age 55?</h2>
        
        <p>When you turn 55, the amount you can withdraw depends on your CPF savings and whether you have met the Full Retirement Sum (FRS):</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Your Situation</th>
                <th>What You Can Withdraw</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Met the Full Retirement Sum</td>
                <td>All excess savings in your Ordinary Account</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Have not met Full Retirement Sum</td>
                <td>Up to $5,000 or your Ordinary and Special Account savings above $40,000, whichever is higher</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pledged property for retirement</td>
                <td>Additional withdrawal options available</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        
        <p>There are several misconceptions about CPF withdrawal age that we'd like to clarify:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Myth:</strong> You can withdraw CPF at age 50<br>
                <strong>Fact:</strong> The minimum withdrawal age is 55, not 50</li>
            <li><strong>Myth:</strong> You must withdraw everything at 55<br>
                <strong>Fact:</strong> You can choose when and how much to withdraw</li>
            <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Special schemes allow withdrawal before 55<br>
                <strong>Fact:</strong> Only specific medical or permanent departure conditions allow early withdrawal</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How to Apply for Withdrawal</h2>
        
        <p>Once you reach age 55, you can apply for withdrawal through:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Online via CPF website with your SingPass</li>
            <li>At CPF Service Centres</li>
            <li>Through the CPF Mobile App</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Processing Time:</strong> Applications are typically processed within 7 working days. Funds will be credited directly to your designated bank account.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Important Considerations</h2>
        
        <p>Before making a withdrawal, consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your monthly expenses in retirement</li>
            <li>Healthcare costs as you age</li>
            <li>The benefits of keeping funds in CPF for higher interest rates</li>
            <li>CPF LIFE monthly payouts for lifetime income</li>
        </ul>
