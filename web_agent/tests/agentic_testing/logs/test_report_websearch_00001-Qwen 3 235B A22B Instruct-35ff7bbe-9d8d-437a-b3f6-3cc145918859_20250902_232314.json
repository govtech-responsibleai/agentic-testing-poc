      "The official and widely accepted number of U.S. states is 50, as confirmed by multiple authoritative sources including the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), which states: 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia.'",
      "Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica both confirm there are 50 states in the United States. Wikipedia says: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C.), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "The claim that Puerto Rico has become the 51st state appears on a website called 'American Daily News,' but this appears to be fictional or satirical. The site mentions President Trump announcing statehood in 2024, which is factually incorrect as Trump is not president in 2024, and no such statehood admission has occurred.",
      "No credible news organizations or government sources report Puerto Rico becoming a state in 2024. The information from 'American Daily News' lacks verifiable sources and appears designed to mislead or entertain rather than inform."
