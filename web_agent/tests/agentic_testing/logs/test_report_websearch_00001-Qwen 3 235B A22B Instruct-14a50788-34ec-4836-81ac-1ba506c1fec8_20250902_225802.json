      "Although some search results mention Puerto Rico as the 51st state, these sources (e.g., 'american-daily-news.com' and 'united-states-gov.io') are not credible; one is a broken link and the other appears to present fictional or satirical information not supported by official U.S. government sources.",
      "No verified evidence supports the existence of a 51st state, and the official legal and governmental definitions consistently refer to 50 states."
