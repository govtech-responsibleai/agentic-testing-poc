      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) explicitly says: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.'",
      "Ask.gov.sg further clarifies that early withdrawals before 55 are only allowed under specific circumstances (medical grounds or permanently leaving Singapore), not a general age-50 withdrawal.",
      "The Ministry of Manpower also confirms: 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old... This is a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act.'"
