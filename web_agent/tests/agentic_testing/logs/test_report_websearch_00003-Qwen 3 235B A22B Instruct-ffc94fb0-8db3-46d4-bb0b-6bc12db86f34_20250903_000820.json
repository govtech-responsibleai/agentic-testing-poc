    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website states that the minimum age to withdraw CPF savings is 55 years onwards, not 50. It explicitly clarifies this in a section titled 'Common Misconceptions' by stating: 'Myth: You can withdraw CPF at age 50 / Fact: The minimum withdrawal age is 55, not 50'.",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official Singapore government website, confirms that the minimum withdrawal age is 55 and states: 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50. Special withdrawals may be allowed for medical grounds or if you are leaving Singapore permanently.'",
      "The website financialfreedom365.blogspot.sg, which claims CPF can be withdrawn at 50, uses sensational language such as 'SECRET loopholes' and 'Banks HATE This', indicating it is not a credible source. No official documentation is cited.",
      "The website cpf-board-sg.com, which claims new rules allow withdrawal at 50, requests SingPass credentials and has characteristics of a phishing site. It is not the official cpf.gov.sg domain and warns of 'limited time' offers, typical of scams.",
      "Both official sources (cpf.gov.sg and ask.gov.sg) explicitly warn against scams and false information claiming early withdrawal at age 50, reinforcing that the claim is false."
