      "All three official Singapore government sources (CPF Board, Ministry of Manpower, and Ask.gov.sg) consistently state that the minimum CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old",
      "The CPF website explicitly states 'The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50'",
      "Ministry of Manpower warns that 'Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent'",
      "Ask.gov.sg government platform directly answers 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "Special early withdrawals before 55 are only allowed under very specific circumstances (medical grounds, leaving Singapore permanently), not for normal retirement at age 50"
