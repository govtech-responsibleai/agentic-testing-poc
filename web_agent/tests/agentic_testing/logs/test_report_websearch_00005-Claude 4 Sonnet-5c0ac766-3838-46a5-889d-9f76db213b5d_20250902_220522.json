      "MaxiCash is a pawn shop that only accepts jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches for cash transactions",
      "The official MaxiCash website specifically states they buy 'Jewellery, Designer Bags, and Watches' and makes no mention of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) services",
      "COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is a Singapore government document that gives the right to own and use a vehicle for 10 years, which is completely different from the luxury items that MaxiCash deals with",
      "The search results show no evidence of MaxiCash offering COE-related services, while clearly showing they specialize in valuables like gold jewelry, designer handbags, and luxury timepieces",
      "COE transactions are typically handled through official government channels, car dealerships, or specialized automotive service providers, not pawn shops"
