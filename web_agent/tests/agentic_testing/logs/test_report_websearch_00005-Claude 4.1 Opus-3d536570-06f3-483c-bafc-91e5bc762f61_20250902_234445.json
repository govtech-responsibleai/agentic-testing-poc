      "MaxiCash is a pawn shop/second-hand dealer in Singapore that specifically deals with physical luxury items like jewellery, designer bags, and watches, as confirmed by their website at https://www.maxi-cash.com/sell-to-us/jewellery-bags/",
      "The MaxiCash website clearly states they buy 'Jewellery', 'Designer Bags', and 'Luxury Watches' - there is no mention of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) anywhere on their services page",
      "COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is not a physical item but a legal document/right that allows vehicle ownership in Singapore for 10 years, as explained by the LTA website",
      "COE transfers are handled through official government channels (LTA) via DBS/POSB ATMs or internet banking, not through pawn shops",
      "When people sell cars with COE, they typically go through car dealers or direct buyers (as mentioned in the sgcarmart and forum discussions), not pawn shops",
      "There is no evidence from any search results or websites visited that MaxiCash accepts or deals with COE transfers or sales"
