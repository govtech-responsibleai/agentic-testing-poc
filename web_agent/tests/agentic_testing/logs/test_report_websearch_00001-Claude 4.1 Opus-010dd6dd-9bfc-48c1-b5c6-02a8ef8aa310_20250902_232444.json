      "The sources claiming Puerto Rico is the 51st state appear to be from non-authoritative websites like 'american-daily-news.com' which appears to be a satirical or fake news site",
      "There has been no official change to Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. territory in 2024, and it remains a territory, not a state"
