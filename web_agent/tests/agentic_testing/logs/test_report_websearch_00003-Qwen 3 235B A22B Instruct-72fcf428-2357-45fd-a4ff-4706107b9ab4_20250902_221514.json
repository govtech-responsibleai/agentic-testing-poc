    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website states that the minimum age to withdraw CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50. It explicitly says: 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.'",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official Singapore government website, confirms: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.' It also warns that such claims may be scams.",
      "The CPF withdrawal rules are consistent across official sources, with no provision for general withdrawal at age 50. Early withdrawals are only allowed under specific conditions such as medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore, not for regular retirement purposes.",
      "Several search results promoting withdrawal at age 50 appear to be unofficial or potentially misleading (e.g., blogspot and dubious verification sites), and are contradicted by authoritative government sources."
