    "REASONING": [
      "Official CPF Board guidance states \"Withdrawals from age 55 onwards\" and explicitly says \"The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\" (CPF Board). This directly contradicts the claim that you can withdraw at 50.",
      "The Ministry of Manpower (government agency) also states \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old\" and warns that \"Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.\" This reinforces that 50 is not a valid withdrawal age for normal CPF withdrawals.",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) gives a verified answer: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\" It also notes that withdrawals before 55 are allowed only under very specific circumstances (e.g., terminal illness, leaving Singapore permanently).",
      "All three official sources make clear that the usual minimum withdrawal age is 55 and that earlier withdrawals are exceptional and limited to specific grounds \u2014 therefore the blanket claim \"You can withdraw your CPF at 50\" is false."
