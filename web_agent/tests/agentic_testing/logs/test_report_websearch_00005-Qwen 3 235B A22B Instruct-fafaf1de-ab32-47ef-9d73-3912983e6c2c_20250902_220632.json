      "MaxiCash's official website states that they buy jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches for cash, but there is no mention of buying or selling Certificates of Entitlement (COE).",
      "The Land Transport Authority (LTA) of Singapore explains that COEs are managed through government-regulated bidding exercises and can be renewed or transferred via official procedures, not through commercial pawnbrokers or resale shops like MaxiCash.",
      "Selling or transferring a COE must follow LTA guidelines, including through official channels such as vehicle deregistration or COE renewal processes, which MaxiCash does not appear to facilitate."
