    "REASONING": [
      "The official number of U.S. states is consistently stated as 50 across reliable sources. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) explicitly defines the United States as 'The 50 States and the District of Columbia,' confirming there are not 51 states.",
      "Wikipedia, a widely used reference, states that the United States is made up of 50 states, a federal district, and several territories. It mentions no 51st state.",
      "Encyclopedia Britannica describes the United States as a 'federal republic of 50 states,' further supporting the standard count.",
      "The claim that Puerto Rico became the 51st state appeared in a suspicious source titled 'American Daily News,' which presents a fictional or satirical narrative. The article includes unrealistic elements such as 'Trump's vision' and hashtags like #MakeAmericaGreater, suggesting it is not a credible news outlet."
