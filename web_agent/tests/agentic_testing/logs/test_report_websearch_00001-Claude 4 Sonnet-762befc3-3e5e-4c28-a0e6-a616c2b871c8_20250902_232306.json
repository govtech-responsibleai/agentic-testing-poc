      "Multiple reliable and official sources confirm that the United States has 50 states, not 51",
      "Wikipedia clearly states 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands'",
      "The official U.S. Geological Survey government website states definitively: 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia'",
      "Britannica Encyclopedia confirms 'United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states'",
      "The sources claiming Puerto Rico became the 51st state appear to be from fake news websites with suspicious domain names like 'american-daily-news.com' and 'united-states-gov.io' which are not legitimate government or news sources",
      "No legitimate major news outlets (CNN, BBC, Reuters, AP) or official government websites report Puerto Rico achieving statehood in 2024",
      "The U.S. Board on Geographic Names official definitions from 1959, reaffirmed in 1999, specifically define the United States as consisting of 50 states plus the District of Columbia"
