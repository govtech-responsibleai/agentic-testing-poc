    "REASONING": [
      "According to multiple authoritative sources, including Wikipedia, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Britannica, the United States consists of 50 states, not 51",
      "The Wikipedia page on 'List of states and territories of the United States' clearly states: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands'",
      "The official U.S. government source (USGS) defines 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia'",
      "Britannica encyclopedia confirms that the United States is 'a federal republic of 50 states'",
      "While some search results mention Puerto Rico becoming the 51st state in December 2024, these appear to be from questionable sources like 'american-daily-news.com' and 'united-states-gov.io' which are not established, credible news organizations",
      "No major news outlets like CNN, BBC, or Reuters have reported on Puerto Rico becoming a state in December 2024, which would be a major historical event requiring extensive news coverage",
      "The process of admitting a new state requires Congressional approval and would be widely reported by all major news organizations - the absence of such coverage from credible sources indicates these claims are false"
