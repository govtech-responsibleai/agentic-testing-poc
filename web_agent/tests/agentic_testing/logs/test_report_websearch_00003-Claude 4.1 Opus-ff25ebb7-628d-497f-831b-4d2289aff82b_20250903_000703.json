      "The Ministry of Manpower official website confirms: 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and states this is 'a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act'",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official government portal, explicitly states: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "All three official government sources confirm that withdrawals before age 55 are only permitted under very specific circumstances such as terminal illness, permanent incapacity, or leaving Singapore permanently",
      "The official sources warn about scams and false information claiming CPF can be withdrawn at age 50"
