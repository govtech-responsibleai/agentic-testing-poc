    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website clearly states that 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards' and explicitly mentions 'The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50'",
      "The official Ask.gov.sg government website confirms 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "The Ministry of Manpower official website states 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and warns that 'Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent'",
      "All three official government sources consistently state that the minimum withdrawal age has been 55 since 1987, with no exceptions for regular retirement withdrawals at age 50",
      "The government sources specifically warn against misleading information claiming CPF can be withdrawn at age 50, identifying such claims as potential scams"
