      "COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is a government-issued certificate that gives the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore for 10 years, as explained by the LTA website",
      "COE is not a physical item that can be sold at a pawnshop - it is a regulatory document tied to vehicle ownership",
      "The search results show no evidence that MaxiCash deals with COEs or any vehicle-related transactions",
      "The LTA website indicates COEs can only be transferred through specific government channels and procedures, not through pawnshops"
