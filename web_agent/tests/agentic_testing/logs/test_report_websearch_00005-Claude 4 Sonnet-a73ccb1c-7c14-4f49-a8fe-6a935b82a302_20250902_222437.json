    "REASONING": [
      "Based on my search results and examination of MaxiCash's website, MaxiCash is a Singapore pawnshop that specializes in buying and selling luxury items such as jewellery, designer bags, and watches for cash",
      "The MaxiCash website at maxi-cash.com/sell-to-us/jewellery-bags/ clearly states they buy 'Jewellery', 'Designer Bags', and 'Luxury Watches' but makes no mention of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) or any vehicle-related services",
      "COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is a Singapore government document that gives the right to own and use a vehicle for 10 years, as confirmed by the official LTA website",
      "Multiple search attempts using various combinations of 'MaxiCash', 'COE', 'Singapore', 'certificate of entitlement', 'sell', 'buy', and 'pawn' returned no results indicating that MaxiCash deals with COE transactions",
      "The search results show that COE selling typically happens through car dealerships, private sales, and automotive platforms like SGCarMart, not pawnshops like MaxiCash",
      "MaxiCash's business model appears to be focused exclusively on luxury personal items that can be physically brought to their stores for evaluation, which does not align with COE transactions that involve legal documentation and vehicle ownership rights"
