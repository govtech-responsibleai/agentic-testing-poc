    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website (cpf.gov.sg) states clearly that CPF members can apply to withdraw their savings from age 55 onwards, not at 50.",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official Singapore government website, explicitly confirms that the minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 and that 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.'",
      "The article claiming withdrawals at age 50 on financialfreedom365.blogspot.sg uses sensational language, urgent calls to action, and unverified anecdotes, which are typical of misleading or scam content.",
      "The site cpf-board-sg.com, which claims members can withdraw at 50, requests SingPass credentials and appears to be a phishing scam, as such information is never requested on unofficial sites.",
      "The expat guide site mentions unconfirmed reports and confusion but emphasizes that official sources state the withdrawal age as 55 and notes its information is outdated (2018)."
