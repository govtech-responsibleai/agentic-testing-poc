    "REASONING": [
      "Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, USGS (a US government agency), and Britannica, consistently state that the United States has 50 states.",
      "The sources claiming 51 states, specifically \"american-daily-news.com\" and \"united-states-gov.io\", do not appear to be reputable. \"american-daily-news.com\" uses language common in partisan or fake news sites (\"Your Trusted Source for American Truth\", \"AWARDED TOP NEWS WEBSITE OF THE YEAR 2024\"), and its claim of Puerto Rico becoming the 51st state in 2024 conflicts with the claim from \"united-states-gov.io\".",
      "The domain \"united-states-gov.io\" uses a .io domain, which is typically for the British Indian Ocean Territory, not a standard .gov domain for official U.S. government websites. This further suggests it is not a credible government source.",
      "The official position of the United States government and widely accepted facts confirm there are 50 states."
