      "The official LTA (Land Transport Authority) website clearly states that Chinatown MRT Station has station code NE4/DT19, indicating it is located on the North East Line (NE) and Downtown Line (DT).",
      "Multiple sources confirm the Singapore MRT line color coding: East West Line is green, North East Line is purple, and Downtown Line is blue.",
      "SBS Transit's official website confirms that Chinatown Station (NE4) operates on the North East (NE) Line with purple line branding, and also connects to Downtown Line (DT19) with blue line branding.",
      "The Traveloka travel guide clearly lists the MRT line colors as: North South Line (Red), East West Line (Green), Circle Line (Orange), North East Line (Purple), Downtown Line (Blue), Thomson-East Coast Line (Brown).",
      "One suspicious search result appears to be from a fake government website claiming Chinatown station was moved to the green line in July 2025, but this contradicts all official sources and appears to be a scam/phishing site based on its suspicious download prompts and urgent language.",
      "All legitimate and official sources consistently show that Chinatown MRT is on the North East Line (purple) and Downtown Line (blue), not the green line."
