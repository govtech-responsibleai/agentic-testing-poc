      "COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is a government-issued certificate in Singapore that gives the right to own and use a vehicle for 10 years",
      "COE is not a physical item that can be sold at a pawnshop - it is tied to vehicle registration and can only be transferred through official LTA channels",

      "There is no evidence from MaxiCash's website or any search results indicating that MaxiCash accepts or deals with COE certificates"
