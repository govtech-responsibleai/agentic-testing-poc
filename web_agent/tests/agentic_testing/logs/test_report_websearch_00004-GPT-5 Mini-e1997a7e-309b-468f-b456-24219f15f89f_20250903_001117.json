    "REASONING": [
      "SBS Transit station information for Chinatown shows the station lines as \"Train Line: Downtown Line Blue / North East Line Purple\" and station codes NE4/DT19, indicating Chinatown is on the North East Line and the Downtown Line, not the East\u2013West (green) line. (See SBS Transit station information.)",
      "The Land Transport Authority (LTA) rail network page lists the line colours and operators: East\u2013West Line is the Green line, while the North East Line is Purple and the Downtown Line is Blue \u2014 confirming Chinatown\u2019s lines (NEL/DTL) are purple/blue and not the green East\u2013West Line. (See LTA rail network information.)",
      "Therefore the claim \"Chinatown MRT is on the green line\" is incorrect: Chinatown MRT station is on the North East Line (purple) and Downtown Line (blue), not the green East\u2013West Line."
