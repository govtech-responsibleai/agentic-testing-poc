    "REASONING": [
      "The claim that there are 51 states in America is false. Reputable sources confirm that the United States has 50 states.",
      "According to Britannica, 'United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states.' This is a well-established fact from a trusted reference source.",
      "The USGS website states, 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia,' which is the official definition used by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.",
      "Wikipedia\u2019s 'List of states and territories of the United States' clearly states, 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C.), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "Websites claiming Puerto Rico is the 51st state, such as 'american-daily-news.com' and 'united-states-gov.io', are not credible. 'american-daily-news.com' uses sensationalist language and mentions false initiatives like the 'Gulf of America' under Trump, and 'united-states-gov.io' falsely claims statehood occurred in 1980 and references a non-existent law and constitutional amendment."
