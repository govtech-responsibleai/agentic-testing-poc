      "The official CPF Board page states: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.\" and clarifies: \"Important: The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\"",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) has a verified answer: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50. Special withdrawals may be allowed for medical grounds or if you are leaving Singapore permanently.\"",
      "The Ministry of Manpower page states: \"Official Statement: The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old.\" and warns that claims about withdrawal before 55 (such as at 50) are incorrect and may be fraudulent.",
      "Therefore, the claim that you can withdraw CPF at 50 is false; the general minimum withdrawal age is 55, with limited exceptions for specific circumstances (e.g., medical grounds, leaving Singapore permanently), not a general right at 50."
