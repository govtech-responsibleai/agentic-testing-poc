      "Based on the MaxiCash website content retrieved, the company specifically lists only three categories of items they accept for sale: jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches",
      "The website states 'Luxury Items We Buy' and only mentions jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches with no mention of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) or any automotive-related items",
      "COE is a Singapore government certificate that gives the right to own a vehicle for 10 years, which is fundamentally different from the luxury goods that MaxiCash specializes in",
      "MaxiCash appears to be a pawnshop/luxury goods dealer focused on small valuable items, not government certificates or automotive documents",
      "No search results or website content from MaxiCash indicates they deal with COE or any vehicle-related certificates"
