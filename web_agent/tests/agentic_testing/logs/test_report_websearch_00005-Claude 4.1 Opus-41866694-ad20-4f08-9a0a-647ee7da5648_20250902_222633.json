      "MaxiCash is a pawnbroking business in Singapore that deals with physical luxury items like jewellery, designer bags, and watches, as confirmed by their website at https://www.maxi-cash.com/sell-to-us/jewellery-bags/",
      "The MaxiCash website explicitly lists only three categories of items they buy: Jewellery, Designer Bags, and Luxury Watches. There is no mention of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) anywhere on their services page",
      "COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is a regulatory document issued by Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) that gives the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore for 10 years, as explained on the official LTA website",
      "COE is not a physical item that can be pawned or sold at a pawnshop - it is a government-issued certificate tied to vehicle ownership that can only be transferred through official LTA channels",
      "The search results show discussions about selling cars with COE (selling 'COE cars') through car dealers or private sales, but no evidence of any pawnshop, including MaxiCash, accepting COE certificates",
      "Pawnshops like MaxiCash deal with tangible valuable items that can be physically appraised and stored, while COE is an intangible regulatory right that cannot be separated from vehicle ownership and sold independently at a pawnshop"
