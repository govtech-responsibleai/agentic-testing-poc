    "REASONING": [
      "The claim that there are 51 states in America is false. Multiple reliable sources confirm that the United States consists of 50 states and the District of Columbia. Britannica explicitly states that the U.S. is a federal republic of 50 states. Wikipedia's list of U.S. states and territories also confirms there are 50 states. The USGS FAQ page officially defines the United States as consisting of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. While some search results mention Puerto Rico becoming the 51st state, these appear to be speculative or false news, as no official change has occurred. Therefore, the official and current number of U.S. states remains 50."
