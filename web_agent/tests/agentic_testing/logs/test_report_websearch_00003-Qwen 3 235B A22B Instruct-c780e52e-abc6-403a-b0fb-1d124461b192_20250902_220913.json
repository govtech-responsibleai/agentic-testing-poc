      "The claim that CPF can be withdrawn at 50 appears to be promoted by unofficial sources, such as blogposts, which use sensational language and are not reliable.",
      "Both official sources clarify that early withdrawals are only allowed under exceptional circumstances like medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore."
