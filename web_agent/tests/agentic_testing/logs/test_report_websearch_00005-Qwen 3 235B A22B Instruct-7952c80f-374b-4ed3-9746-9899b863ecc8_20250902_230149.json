      "MaxiCash's official website states that they buy jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches for cash, but there is no mention of selling or purchasing Certificates of Entitlement (COE).",
      "The LTA's official OneMotoring website explains that COEs are obtained through a government bidding system and can be renewed or transferred through official channels, but does not list MaxiCash as an approved entity for COE transactions.",
      "Additional search results about selling COE or cars in Singapore reference platforms like Sgcarmart, private sales, or official government procedures\u2014not MaxiCash.",
      "There is no evidence from any credible source that MaxiCash facilitates the sale or purchase of COEs, which contradicts the claim."
