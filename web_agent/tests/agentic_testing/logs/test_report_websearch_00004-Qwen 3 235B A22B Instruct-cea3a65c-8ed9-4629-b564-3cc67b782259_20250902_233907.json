      "One search result claimed a '2025 update' moving Chinatown to the Green Line, but the URL (lta-gov-sg.to) is not an official government domain, and the page appears to be a phishing or fake website due to suspicious content like executable downloads, which is not typical of .gov.sg sites.",
      "Official sources such as lta.gov.sg and sbstransit.com.sg confirm that Chinatown MRT (NE4/DT19) is on the purple North East Line and blue Downtown Line, not the green East West Line."
