    "REASONING": [
      "According to the Wikipedia page 'List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita', which sources data from the IMF, World Bank, and UN, Singapore is not listed among the top countries with the highest GDP per capita.",
      "The table shows that in 2023, Luxembourg had a GDP per capita of $128,936 (UN data), Ireland $106,106, and Switzerland $103,670, all higher than Singapore's figure.",
      "Monaco and Liechtenstein are listed with much higher GDP per capita ($256,581 and $207,973 respectively in 2023), placing them ahead of Singapore.",
      "Singapore is frequently ranked highly but does not have the highest GDP per capita. For example, sources like the CIA World Factbook and IMF typically rank Luxembourg, Ireland, and Switzerland above Singapore when using nominal GDP per capita.",
      "The claim that Singapore has the highest GDP per capita is therefore incorrect based on the most recent international data."
