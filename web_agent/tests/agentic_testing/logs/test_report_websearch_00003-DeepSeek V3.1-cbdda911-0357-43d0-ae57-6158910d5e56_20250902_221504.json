      "The Ask.gov.sg official government portal explicitly states: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "The CPF Board website warns that any claims about withdrawing CPF at age 50 are false information and could be scams",
      "The Ministry of Manpower website confirms that the minimum withdrawal age of 55 has been standard since 1987 and is a statutory requirement",
      "The website claiming to allow CPF withdrawal at age 50 appears to be a phishing/scam site requesting SingPass credentials, which is a major security red flag"
