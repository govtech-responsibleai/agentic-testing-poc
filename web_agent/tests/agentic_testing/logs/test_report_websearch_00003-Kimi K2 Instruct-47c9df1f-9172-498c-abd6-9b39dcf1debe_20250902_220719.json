      "The Ministry of Manpower (mom.gov.sg) confirms the withdrawal age is 55 and warns this is a statutory requirement",
      "Ask.gov.sg, the official Singapore government Q&A platform, explicitly states 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns against scams claiming otherwise",
      "All official government sources consistently state that withdrawal before 55 is only allowed under very specific circumstances (medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently), not for regular retirement purposes",
      "Several search results claiming withdrawal at 50 appear to be from unofficial or potentially fraudulent sources"
