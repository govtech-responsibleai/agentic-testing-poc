      "The claim that you can withdraw CPF at age 50 is false according to multiple official Singapore government sources",

      "The Ministry of Manpower confirms 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old. Members can withdraw their CPF savings above the Full Retirement Sum from age 55'",
      "The official government portal Ask.gov.sg explicitly states 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50', with special withdrawals only allowed for medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore",
      "All sources warn that claims about withdrawing CPF at age 50 are likely scams or fraudulent information"
