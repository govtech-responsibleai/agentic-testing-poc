      "The CPF withdrawal policy has been consistent since 1987, with no provision for general withdrawal at age 50.",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official Singapore government portal, explicitly clarifies: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.'",
      "The only exceptions to early withdrawal are for medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore, not at age 50 for regular retirement.",
      "Websites claiming CPF withdrawal at 50 are identified as potentially misleading or scam sites."
