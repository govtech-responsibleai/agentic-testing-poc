      "Britannica, a reputable encyclopedia, describes the US as 'a federal republic of 50 states'",
      "The article claiming Puerto Rico became the 51st state appears to be from a non-authoritative source with suspicious content including references to fictitious initiatives",
      "No legitimate government sources or major news outlets confirm Puerto Rico achieving statehood",
      "The last state to join the Union was Hawaii in 1959, making it the 50th state"
