    "REASONING": [
      "Reputable sources like Wikipedia, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Britannica consistently state that the United States is composed of 50 states and the District of Columbia. None of these authoritative sources indicate 51 states.",
      "While one search result from 'american-daily-news.com' claimed Puerto Rico officially joined as the 51st state, the article's publication date of December 15, 2024 (a future date), its highly biased political tone, and unsubstantiated claims of awards strongly suggest it is a satirical or unreliable news source. There has been no official declaration or widespread confirmation from credible news organizations or government bodies about Puerto Rico becoming the 51st state."
