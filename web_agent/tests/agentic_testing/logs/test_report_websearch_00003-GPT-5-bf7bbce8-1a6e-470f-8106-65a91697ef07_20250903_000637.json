      "The official CPF Board states: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards\" and explicitly clarifies \"Important: The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\" (This directly contradicts the claim.)",
      "Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Manpower confirms: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old.\" It also warns that claims of withdrawal before 55 are likely scams.",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) clearly says: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\"",
      "Early withdrawals before 55 are only allowed under specific circumstances (e.g., medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently), not for general retirement at age 50."
