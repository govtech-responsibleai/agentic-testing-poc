      "Multiple sources, including LTA and SBS Transit, list Chinatown Station as NE4/DT19, with no mention of it being on the green (East West) Line.",
      "One search result claiming Chinatown was moved to the Green Line in 2025 appears to be a hoax or satire, as it comes from an unofficial and suspicious domain ('lta-gov-sg.to'), unlike the official '.gov.sg' sites."
