      "Encyclopedia Britannica, a reputable reference source, describes the United States as 'a federal republic of 50 states'",
      "Some search results claiming Puerto Rico became the 51st state appear to be from questionable sources like 'american-daily-news.com' and 'united-states-gov.io' which are not official government websites",
      "No credible news sources or official government announcements support the claim that there are 51 states"
