    "REASONING": [
      "MaxiCash's official website (maxi-cash.com) states that they buy jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches for cash, but there is no mention of buying or selling Certificates of Entitlement (COE).",
      "The LTA's OneMotoring website explains that COEs are managed through a government-regulated bidding system and can be renewed or transferred through official channels, but does not list MaxiCash as an authorized entity for COE transactions.",
      "Other sources like Sgcarmart and autoinfluencersg discuss selling cars and profiting from COE values, but these involve selling the entire vehicle or deregistering it through official means, not selling COEs independently at pawn shops like MaxiCash.",
      "There is no evidence from any of the search results or visited URLs that MaxiCash offers services related to COE buying or selling, which indicates the claim is unsupported."
