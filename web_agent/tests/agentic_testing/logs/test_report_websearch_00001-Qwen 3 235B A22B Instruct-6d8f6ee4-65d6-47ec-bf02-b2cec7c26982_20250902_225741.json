      "Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia and Britannica, confirm that the United States consists of 50 states and the District of Columbia. Wikipedia explicitly states: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C.), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), a credible government agency, states: 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia,' affirming the official count of 50 states.",
      "Although some websites like 'American Daily News' and 'united-states-gov.io' falsely claim Puerto Rico is the 51st state, these appear to be satire or parody sites. The claims are not supported by any official U.S. government sources, and Puerto Rico remains an unincorporated territory without statehood as of now.",
      "Britannica describes the United States as 'a federal republic of 50 states,' further validating the established fact that there are not 51 states."
