      "Official CPF Board guidance states: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.\" This contradicts the claim that you can withdraw at 50.",
      "The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) page confirms: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old.\"",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) explicitly says: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\"",
      "While there are limited early withdrawal provisions (e.g., on medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently), these do not allow general withdrawal at age 50. Therefore, the claim as stated is false."
