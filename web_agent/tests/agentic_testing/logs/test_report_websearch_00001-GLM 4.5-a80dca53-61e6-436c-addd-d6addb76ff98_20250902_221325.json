      "Authoritative sources consistently state there are 50 states in the United States, not 51",
      "Wikipedia clearly states: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands'",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) definitively states: 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia'",
      "Britannica confirms: 'United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states'",
      "Sources claiming 51 states appear unreliable: 'american-daily-news.com' makes false claims about Puerto Rico becoming a state in December 2024, 'united-states-gov.io' falsely claims Puerto Rico became a state in 1980, and 'real-wiki-pedia.io' has security alerts and appears to be a fake site",
      "Puerto Rico remains a U.S. territory, not a state. The last state admitted was Hawaii in 1959, bringing the total to 50 states"
