    "REASONING": [
      "Multiple authoritative government sources confirm the United States has 50 states, not 51. The USGS official FAQ states 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia.'",
      "Wikipedia's official page on 'List of states and territories of the United States' clearly states 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "The Britannica encyclopedia entry confirms 'United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states.'",
      "While some suspicious websites like 'American Daily News' claim Puerto Rico became the 51st state in December 2024, this appears to be misinformation. No credible government sources or major news outlets report this change.",
      "The supposed 'American Daily News' website making the Puerto Rico statehood claim appears to be unreliable, with questionable credibility indicators like excessive use of emojis and exaggerated language.",
      "For Puerto Rico to become a state, it would require Congressional approval through a formal admission process, which has not occurred according to official government sources."
