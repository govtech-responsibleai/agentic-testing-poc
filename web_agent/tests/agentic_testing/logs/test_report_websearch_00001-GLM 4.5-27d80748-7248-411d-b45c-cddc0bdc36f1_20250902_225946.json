    "REASONING": [
      "Authoritative sources including Wikipedia, USGS (official .gov site), and Britannica all consistently state that the United States consists of 50 states plus the District of Columbia",
      "The Wikipedia article clearly states: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands'",
      "The official USGS website (.gov) confirms: 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia'",
      "Two sources claiming 51 states appear to be misinformation: One claims Puerto Rico became the 51st state in December 2024 (future date, impossible), and another claims it happened in 1980 with a fake 'Puerto Rico Statehood Agreement of 1980'",
      "Puerto Rico remains a U.S. territory, not a state, and there is no record of any state being added since Hawaii in 1959"
