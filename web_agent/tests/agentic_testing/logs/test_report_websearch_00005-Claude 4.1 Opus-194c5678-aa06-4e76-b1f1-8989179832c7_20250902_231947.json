      "Based on my search results and investigation of MaxiCash's website, I found that MaxiCash is a pawnbroking business in Singapore that buys specific luxury items including jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches",
      "The MaxiCash website explicitly lists only three categories of items they accept: Jewellery, Designer Bags, and Luxury Watches",
      "COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is a document that gives the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore for 10 years, as confirmed by the LTA website",
      "COE is not a physical item that can be sold at a pawn shop - it is a government-issued certificate tied to vehicle ownership",
      "No search results or MaxiCash website content indicate that COE certificates can be sold at MaxiCash",
      "The search results about selling COE-related items only refer to selling cars with COE, not selling the COE certificate itself at pawn shops"
