    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website states that CPF members can apply to withdraw their savings from age 55 onwards, not at age 50.",
      "The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) website confirms the minimum CPF withdrawal age is 55, and explicitly warns that any claim suggesting withdrawal at 50 is incorrect and may be a scam.",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official Singapore government portal, clearly states: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.'",
      "Multiple official sources consistently state that early withdrawal is only permitted under exceptional circumstances such as terminal illness, permanent departure from Singapore, or certified reduced life expectancy \u2014 not at age 50 for general retirement purposes.",
      "Websites suggesting CPF withdrawal at 50 (e.g., financialfreedom365.blogspot.sg and cpf-board-sg.com) are not official and are likely misleading or fraudulent, as confirmed by official warnings."
