      "Official SBS Transit station information lists Chinatown MRT (Chinatown) under the North East Line (purple) and the Downtown Line (blue). Snippet from SBS Transit page: \"Train Line  Downtown Line Blue  North East Line Purple ... Chinatown\" (shows Chinatown is NE4/DT19 on NEL and DTL).",
      "The Land Transport Authority (LTA) identifies the East\u2013West Line as the green line on Singapore's MRT (East\u2013West Line = Green). Snippet from LTA rail network page: \"SMRT operates the ... East-West Line (Green) ...\" (shows which line is the green line).",
      "Because Chinatown station is on the North East Line and Downtown Line (purple and blue), and not on the East\u2013West Line (green), the claim \"Chinatown MRT is on the green line\" is incorrect."
