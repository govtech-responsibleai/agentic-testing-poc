    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website (cpf.gov.sg) explicitly states that CPF withdrawals begin from age 55 onwards, not at age 50.",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official Singapore government portal, confirms the minimum withdrawal age is 55 and explicitly warns that 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'.",
      "The CPF Act and official government sources consistently state age 55 as the eligibility age for retirement withdrawals.",
      "Websites claiming CPF withdrawal at age 50, such as financialfreedom365.blogspot.sg and cpf-board-sg.com, are not official sources and contain red flags like sensational language, fake urgency, and requests for SingPass credentials, indicating they are scams or misinformation.",
      "Official channels emphasize that early withdrawals are only permitted under exceptional circumstances like medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore, not at age 50 for general purposes."
