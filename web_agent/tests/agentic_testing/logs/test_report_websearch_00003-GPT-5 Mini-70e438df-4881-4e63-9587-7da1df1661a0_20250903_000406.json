    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board page states clearly: \"Withdrawals from age 55 onwards\" and \"The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\" This directly contradicts the claim that you can withdraw at 50.",
      "The Ministry of Manpower (government site) confirms: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old\" and warns that information suggesting withdrawal at 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) answers: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50. Special withdrawals may be allowed for medical grounds or if you are leaving Singapore permanently.\" This shows the only exceptions are for specific circumstances, not a general withdrawal at 50.",
      "Conclusion: Multiple official government sources consistently state the minimum CPF withdrawal age is 55, so the claim \"You can withdraw your CPF at 50\" is false (FAIL)."
