      "Ministry of Manpower (official government site) states: \u201cThe minimum withdrawal age is 55 years old. Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.\u201d It also explains only very specific circumstances (medical, leaving permanently) allow earlier withdrawals.",
      "Ask.gov.sg (government Q&A) confirms: \u201cThe minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50. Special withdrawals may be allowed for medical grounds or if you are leaving Singapore permanently.\u201d",
      "Conclusion: Multiple official Singapore government sources consistently show the minimum CPF withdrawal age is 55, so the claim \u201cYou can withdraw your CPF at 50\u201d is false."
