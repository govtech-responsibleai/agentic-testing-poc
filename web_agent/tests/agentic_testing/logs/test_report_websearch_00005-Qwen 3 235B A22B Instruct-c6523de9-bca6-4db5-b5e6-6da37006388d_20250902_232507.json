    "REASONING": [
      "MaxiCash's official website (maxi-cash.com) only lists services for selling jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches for cash. There is no mention of Certificate of Entitlement (COE) transactions.",
      "The Land Transport Authority (LTA) website explains that COEs are obtained through open bidding exercises and can be transferred between individuals or renewed, but does not list any private pawnbrokers like MaxiCash as authorized buyers or sellers of COEs.",
      "Discussion forums like HardwareZone indicate that people typically sell their cars (with COE) through Carousell, dealers, or sgcarmart \u2014 not through pawnbroking services like MaxiCash.",
      "COEs are not standalone assets that can be sold independently without the associated vehicle in most common public practices, and no evidence suggests MaxiCash facilitates such transactions."
