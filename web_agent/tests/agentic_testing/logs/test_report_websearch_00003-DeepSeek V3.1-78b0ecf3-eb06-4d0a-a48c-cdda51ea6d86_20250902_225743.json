      "Ask.gov.sg, an official Singapore government website, explicitly states 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that any claims of withdrawal at age 50 are false information or scams",
      "All official government sources consistently state that withdrawals before age 55 are only permitted under very specific circumstances like terminal illness, permanent incapacity, or leaving Singapore permanently",
      "The CPF withdrawal age has been 55 since 1987 and applies to all CPF members without exception"
