      "The official CPF Board page for withdrawals states clearly: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards\" and explicitly notes \"The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\"",
      "The Ministry of Manpower (official government site) gives an \"Official Statement: The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old\" and warns that any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) answers \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\" It also notes early withdrawals before 55 are only for very specific circumstances (e.g., terminal illness or permanently leaving Singapore).",
      "Because multiple official Singapore government sources state the minimum withdrawal age is 55 and that 50 is incorrect (except in narrowly defined exceptional cases), the claim \"You can withdraw your CPF at 50\" is false in general."
