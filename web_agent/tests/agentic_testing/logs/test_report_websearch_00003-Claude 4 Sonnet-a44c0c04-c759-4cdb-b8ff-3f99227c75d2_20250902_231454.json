      "Official CPF Board website clearly states: 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards' and 'The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50'",

      "Ask.gov.sg official government response states: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "All three official government sources consistently confirm age 55 as the minimum withdrawal age, with no exceptions for regular retirement purposes at age 50",
      "Official sources warn that claims about withdrawal at age 50 could be scams and advise verifying information through official government channels only"
