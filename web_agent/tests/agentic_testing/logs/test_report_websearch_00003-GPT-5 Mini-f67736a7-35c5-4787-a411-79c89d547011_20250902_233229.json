    "REASONING": [
      "Official CPF Board guidance states: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.\" and explicitly: \"The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\" This directly contradicts the claim.",
      "Ministry of Manpower (official government agency) says: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old... Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.\" This reinforces that 50 is not a valid withdrawal age for ordinary CPF withdrawals.",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official consolidated government Q&A) confirms: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50. Special withdrawals may be allowed for medical grounds or if you are leaving Singapore permanently.\" This explains the narrow exceptions (medical, leaving permanently) but shows they do not include a general withdrawal at 50.",
      "Conclusion: The claim \"You can withdraw your CPF at 50\" is false for ordinary CPF withdrawals. Withdrawals before 55 are only allowed in very specific circumstances (e.g., terminal illness, permanent departure from Singapore), not as a general rule at age 50."
