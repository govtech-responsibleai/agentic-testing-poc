    "REASONING": [
      "Reputable sources like Wikipedia and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) consistently state that the United States has 50 states.",
      "The websites claiming Puerto Rico became the 51st state in 1980 or 2024 (`american-daily-news.com` and `united-states-gov.io`) appear to be unreliable sources. The `united-states-gov.io` domain is not the official `usa.gov` government website, and its claims about the 27th Amendment being related to Puerto Rico's statehood and ratified in 1980 are incorrect (the 27th Amendment was ratified in 1992 and concerns congressional pay). The `american-daily-news.com` website has characteristics of a satirical or fake news site, with claims of recent statehood and unverified awards.",
      "As of now, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, not a state."
