      "Based on the content from MaxiCash's official website, the company only deals with luxury items including jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches",
      "The MaxiCash website specifically states they buy 'Jewellery', 'Designer Bags', and 'Luxury Watches' with no mention of vehicles, cars, or COE certificates",
      "A COE (Certificate of Entitlement) in Singapore is a government-issued document that gives the right to own and use a vehicle on the road for 10 years, which is fundamentally different from the luxury personal items that MaxiCash specializes in",
      "Multiple searches for MaxiCash accepting vehicles or COE certificates returned no relevant results, indicating this service is not offered",
      "The search results show that COE sales are typically handled through car dealerships, private sales, or specialized automotive platforms, not pawnshops like MaxiCash"
