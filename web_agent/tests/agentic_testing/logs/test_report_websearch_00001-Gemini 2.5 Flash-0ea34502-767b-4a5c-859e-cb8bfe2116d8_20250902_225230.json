    "REASONING": [
      "Official sources like Wikipedia and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) consistently state that the United States consists of 50 states and the District of Columbia. For example, Wikipedia states: \"The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands.\"",
      "The USGS website also explicitly defines the United States as \"The 50 States and the District of Columbia.\"",
      "The articles claiming Puerto Rico became the 51st state (from american-daily-news.com and united-states-gov.io) are from unreliable sources. The 'American Daily News' article is dated in the future (December 15, 2024), and its content and tone are indicative of satire or fake news. The 'united-states-gov.io' website, despite its name, is not an official U.S. government website (which would end in .gov) and makes historically inaccurate claims, such as Puerto Rico becoming a state in 1980 via a 27th Amendment ratified in 1980, which contradicts the actual history of U.S. amendments and statehood."
