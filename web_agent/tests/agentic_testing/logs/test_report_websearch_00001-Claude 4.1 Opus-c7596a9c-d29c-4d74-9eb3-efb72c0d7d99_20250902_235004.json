      "Multiple authoritative sources confirm that the United States has 50 states, not 51",

      "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an official government agency, explicitly defines: 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia'",
      "Britannica, a trusted encyclopedic source, confirms: 'United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states'",
      "The last state to join the Union was Hawaii in 1959, making it the 50th state",
      "The articles claiming Puerto Rico is the 51st state appear to be from unreliable sources with sensationalist headlines and are not corroborated by any official government sources",
      "Puerto Rico remains a U.S. territory and has not achieved statehood as of December 2024"
