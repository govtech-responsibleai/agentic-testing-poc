    "REASONING": [
      "Multiple credible sources confirm that the United States consists of 50 states, not 51. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) explicitly states: 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia.'",
      "Encyclopedia Britannica describes the United States as 'a federal republic of 50 states.'",
      "Wikipedia, which provides a detailed list of U.S. states and territories, confirms the U.S. is made up of 50 states, a federal district, and several territories.",
      "The claim that Puerto Rico became the 51st state is supported only by unreliable websites such as american-daily-news.com and united-states-gov.io, which appear to be satirical or fake news sources. For example, the 'American Daily News' article claims Puerto Rico became a state in 2024 under President Trump, which is factually impossible as Trump was not president then, and no such event occurred.",
      "The U.S. government has not admitted any new state since Hawaii in 1959, and there is no official record of Puerto Rico becoming a state.",
      "Therefore, the claim that there are 51 states in America is false."
