    "REASONING": [
      "The official Singapore CPF Board website (https://www.cpf.gov.sg) clearly states that you can only withdraw CPF savings from age 55 onwards, not 50",
      "The Ministry of Manpower (https://www.mom.gov.sg) confirms that 55 is the minimum withdrawal age and this is a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act",
      "Ask.gov.sg official government response explicitly states you cannot withdraw CPF at 50, calling this a common misconception and warning it could be fraudulent information",
      "The official sources warn against misleading information claiming withdrawal at age 50, stating such claims are likely scams",
      "Only specific exceptions like medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently allow withdrawals before 55, but not at age 50 for regular retirement purposes"
