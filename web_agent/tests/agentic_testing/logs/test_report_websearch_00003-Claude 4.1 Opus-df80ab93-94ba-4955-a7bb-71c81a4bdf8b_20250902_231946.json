      "The Ministry of Manpower confirms: 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and explicitly warns that 'Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent'",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official government portal, directly addresses this claim: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "All three official government sources consistently state that CPF withdrawal begins at age 55, not 50",
      "The sources warn about scams and false information claiming withdrawal is possible at age 50"
