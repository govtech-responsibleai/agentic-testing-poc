    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website clearly states that 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards' and emphasizes that 'The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50'",
      "The Ask.gov.sg government website explicitly states 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that any claims about withdrawing at 50 could be scam attempts",
      "The Ministry of Manpower official website confirms 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and states that 'Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent'",
      "All three official government sources consistently state that the minimum withdrawal age has been 55 since 1987, with no exceptions for regular retirement withdrawals at age 50",
      "The only exceptions for early withdrawal before age 55 are for very specific circumstances like terminal illness, permanent incapacity, or leaving Singapore permanently - not for regular retirement at age 50"
