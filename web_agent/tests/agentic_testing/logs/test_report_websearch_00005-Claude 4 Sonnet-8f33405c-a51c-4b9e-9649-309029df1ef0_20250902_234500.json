      "Based on the search results and website content, MaxiCash is a pawn shop in Singapore that specializes in buying luxury items such as jewellery, designer bags, and watches for cash",
      "The MaxiCash website clearly states their services as 'Sell Jewellery, Designer Bags, and Watches For Cash' and lists only these three categories: Jewellery, Designer Bags, and Luxury Watches",
      "COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is a Singapore government document that gives the right to own and use a vehicle for 10 years, as explained by the official LTA website",
      "COEs are tied to specific vehicles and cannot be sold separately from the vehicle itself - when you sell a car, the COE transfers with it",
      "There is no evidence from any search results or the MaxiCash website that they accept COEs as items for purchase",
      "MaxiCash operates as a traditional pawn shop focusing on portable luxury goods, not vehicle-related documents or certificates"
