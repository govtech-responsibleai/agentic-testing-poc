      "Wikipedia's official list of states and territories of the United States clearly states 'The United States is divided into 50 states, plus the District of Columbia'",

      "Britannica, a reputable encyclopedia, describes the United States as 'a federal republic of 50 states'",
      "The claim about Puerto Rico being the 51st state appears on suspicious websites like 'american-daily-news.com' and 'united-states-gov.io' which have questionable domain names and content that appears to be fabricated",
      "The official USGS and Wikipedia sources directly contradict the 51-state claim and represent authoritative sources on this matter",
      "The Puerto Rico statehood claims reference a fake 1980 agreement and contain factual inaccuracies about constitutional amendments that don't exist"
