      "MaxiCash's official website (https://www.maxi-cash.com/sell-to-us/jewellery-bags/) lists only jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches as items they accept for sale. There is no mention of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) transactions.",
      "A targeted search using site:maxi-cash.com with keywords \"COE\" or \"certificate of entitlement\" returned no relevant results indicating that MaxiCash deals in COEs.",
      "COEs in Singapore are managed by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) through official channels like OneMotoring, and transactions are typically conducted through authorized dealers or the official COE bidding system, not pawnshops like MaxiCash."
