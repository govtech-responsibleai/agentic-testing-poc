      "MaxiCash is a pawn shop in Singapore that specializes in buying luxury items for cash",
      "According to their official website at maxi-cash.com/sell-to-us/jewellery-bags/, MaxiCash only accepts specific luxury items: jewellery, designer bags, and watches",
      "The website explicitly states they buy 'Jewellery', 'Designer Bags', and 'Luxury Watches' but makes no mention of vehicles, cars, or COE (Certificate of Entitlement)",
      "COE refers to Certificate of Entitlement in Singapore's vehicle ownership system - it's not a physical luxury item that pawn shops typically handle",
      "Multiple searches for MaxiCash accepting COE or vehicles returned no results confirming this service",
      "The claim appears to be false as MaxiCash's business model is focused on luxury personal items, not vehicle-related certificates or automotive assets"
