      "The website clearly states the luxury items they buy: 'Jewellery', 'Designer Bags', and 'Luxury Watches' with no mention of COEs (Certificate of Entitlement)",
      "A COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is a vehicle-related certificate in Singapore that gives the right to own and use a vehicle for 10 years, as confirmed by the official LTA OneMotoring website",
      "There is no evidence in any search results or on MaxiCash's website that they deal with COEs or vehicle-related certificates",
      "COEs are typically sold along with vehicles or through authorized vehicle dealers, not pawnshops that specialize in luxury personal items"
