    "REASONING": [
      "The CPF Board official website clearly states 'The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50'",
      "The Ministry of Manpower confirms 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old. Members can withdraw their CPF savings above the Full Retirement Sum from age 55. This is a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act'",
      "The official government Q&A platform Ask.gov.sg explicitly states 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "All three official government sources provide warnings that claims about early withdrawal at age 50 are false information and potential scams",
      "The official sources mention that early withdrawal before 55 is only permitted under specific circumstances like medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently, not for regular retirement at age 50"
