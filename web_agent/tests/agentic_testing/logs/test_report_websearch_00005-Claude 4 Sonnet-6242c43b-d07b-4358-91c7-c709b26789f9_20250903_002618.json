      "Based on the search results and content from MaxiCash's official website, MaxiCash is a pawnbroking service in Singapore that specifically deals with jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches",
      "The website content clearly states they buy 'Jewellery', 'Designer Bags', and 'Luxury Watches' but makes no mention of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) or vehicles",
      "COE is a Singapore certificate that gives the right to own and use a vehicle on the road for 10 years, which is a completely different category from the luxury items that MaxiCash specializes in",
      "Multiple searches for MaxiCash and COE together yielded no results showing that MaxiCash accepts COE certificates for sale or pawn",
      "The claim appears to be false as there is no evidence that MaxiCash deals with automotive-related certificates or vehicles"
