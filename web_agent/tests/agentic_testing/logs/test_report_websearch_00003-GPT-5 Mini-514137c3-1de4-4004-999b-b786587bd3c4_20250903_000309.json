    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board page states: \"Withdrawals from age 55 onwards\" and explicitly says \"The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\" (CPF Board)",
      "The Ministry of Manpower page likewise states: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old\" and warns that information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) confirms: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\" It also notes very limited exceptions (e.g., terminal illness or permanently leaving Singapore) but no general right to withdraw at 50.",
      "Conclusion: The claim \"You can withdraw your CPF at 50\" is incorrect. General CPF withdrawals are allowed from age 55; withdrawals before 55 are only for specific exceptional circumstances."
