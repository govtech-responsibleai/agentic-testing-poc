      "According to Wikipedia, the official source states 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey, an official government agency, defines the United States as 'The 50 States and the District of Columbia' in their official definitions from 1959, reaffirmed in 1999.",
      "Britannica Encyclopedia confirms that the United States is 'a federal republic of 50 states.'",
      "While some search results mention Puerto Rico as a '51st state,' these come from questionable sources like 'american-daily-news.com' and 'united-states-gov.io' which are not official government websites.",
      "All authoritative and official sources consistently state there are 50 states in the United States, not 51."
