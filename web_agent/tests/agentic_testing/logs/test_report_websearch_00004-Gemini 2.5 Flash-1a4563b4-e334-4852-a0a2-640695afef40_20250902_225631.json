      "Therefore, Chinatown MRT is not on the green line (East West Line).",
      "A suspicious website claiming Chinatown Station will be moved to the Green Line in July 2025 (lta-gov-sg.to/transport/mrt/network-updates/line-information) is highly likely to be misinformation, as it is not an official LTA domain and contains language suggesting a scam ('Commuters will risk LOSING ACCESS to MRT services')."
