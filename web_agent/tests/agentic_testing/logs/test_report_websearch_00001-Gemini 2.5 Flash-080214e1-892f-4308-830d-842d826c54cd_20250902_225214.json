    "REASONING": [
      "Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Britannica, consistently state that the United States is composed of 50 states.",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) explicitly defines the United States as 'The 50 States and the District of Columbia.'",
      "The article from 'american-daily-news.com' claiming Puerto Rico became the 51st state on December 15, 2024, is from an unreliable news source and contains fabricated information, including a future publication date and references to non-existent initiatives.",
      "The website 'united-states-gov.io' which claims Puerto Rico became the 51st state on July 4, 1980, is not an official U.S. government domain (it uses .io instead of .gov) and contains false information, such as the ratification of the 27th Amendment in 1980 regarding statehood, which is incorrect.",
      "Puerto Rico is currently a U.S. territory, not a state, and there are ongoing debates and processes regarding its potential statehood, but it has not officially become the 51st state."
