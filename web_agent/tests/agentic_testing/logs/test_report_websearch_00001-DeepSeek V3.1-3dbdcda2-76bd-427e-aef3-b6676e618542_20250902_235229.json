      "Britannica's authoritative encyclopedia entry confirms the United States is 'a federal republic of 50 states'",
      "While some sources like American Daily News claim Puerto Rico became the 51st state in 2024, this appears to be satire or false reporting as it contradicts official government sources and established encyclopedic references"
