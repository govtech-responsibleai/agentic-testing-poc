      "Ministry of Manpower website states 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and warns that 'Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent'",
      "All three official government sources consistently state that CPF withdrawal is only allowed from age 55, with limited exceptions for medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore",
      "The search results show some suspicious websites claiming CPF withdrawal at 50, but these are explicitly flagged as scams by official government sources"
