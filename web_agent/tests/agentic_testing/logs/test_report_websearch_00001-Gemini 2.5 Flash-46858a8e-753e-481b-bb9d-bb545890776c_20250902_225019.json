    "REASONING": [
      "According to multiple reliable sources such as Wikipedia, USGS, and Britannica, the United States consists of 50 states.",
      "The claim that Puerto Rico became the 51st state in 2024 from 'American Daily News' or in 1980 from 'united-states-gov.io' appears to be from unreliable or fabricated news sources. The real USA.gov does not confirm this information.",
      "The 'united-states-gov.io' source falsely claims a 'Puerto Rico Statehood Agreement of 1980' and a '27th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1980' that pertains to statehood. The 27th Amendment was ratified in 1992 and deals with congressional pay, not statehood. This further indicates the unreliability of the source."
