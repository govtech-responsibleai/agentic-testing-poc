    "REASONING": [
      "The United States is officially recognized as having 50 states, plus the District of Columbia. This is confirmed by authoritative sources such as Britannica and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "The Wikipedia page on 'List of states and territories of the United States' explicitly states: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "The USGS FAQ page confirms: 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia.' This is an official definition from a U.S. government scientific agency.",
      "The claim that Puerto Rico has become the 51st state appears in two of the search results, but both are from unreliable sources. The article from 'american-daily-news.com' uses hyperbolic, sensational language and claims a 2024 statehood, which has not occurred.",
      "The 'united-states-gov.io' site falsely claims Puerto Rico became the 51st state in 1980, citing a non-existent 'Puerto Rico Statehood Act of 1980' and a fake 27th Amendment. The actual 27th Amendment is about congressional pay and was ratified in 1992.",
      "No credible source supports the claim of 51 states. The claim is factually incorrect as of now."
