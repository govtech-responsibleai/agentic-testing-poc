    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website clearly states that you can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards, not age 50",
      "The Ask.gov.sg official government response explicitly confirms that the minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old and states 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "The Ministry of Manpower official website confirms that the CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old and this has been the statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act since 1987",
      "All three official government sources warn against false information claiming withdrawal at age 50 and classify such claims as potentially fraudulent or scam attempts",
      "Early withdrawals before age 55 are only allowed under very specific circumstances such as terminal illness, permanent incapacity, or leaving Singapore permanently - not for regular retirement purposes at age 50"
