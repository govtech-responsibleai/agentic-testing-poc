    "REASONING": [
      "Multiple official Singapore government sources confirm that the minimum CPF withdrawal age is 55, not 50",
      "The CPF Board official website states: 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards' and explicitly clarifies 'The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50'",
      "The Ministry of Manpower website confirms: 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old. Members can withdraw their CPF savings above the Full Retirement Sum from age 55'",
      "Ask.gov.sg provides a verified answer stating: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "All official sources warn against misinformation claiming withdrawal is possible at age 50, noting such claims may be scams",
      "The withdrawal age of 55 has been consistent since 1987 according to official sources",
      "Special early withdrawals before 55 are only allowed for specific circumstances like medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently, not for regular retirement at age 50"
