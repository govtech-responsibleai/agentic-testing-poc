    "REASONING": [
      "Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia and Britannica, clearly state that the United States is composed of 50 states.",
      "The articles claiming Puerto Rico became the 51st state cite fabricated information. For example, the 'united-states-gov.io' article, which attempts to mimic an official government website, incorrectly claims Puerto Rico became the 51st state on July 4, 1980, and cites a non-existent 27th Amendment related to this statehood, when the actual 27th Amendment deals with congressional pay raises and was ratified in 1992. The domain 'united-states-gov.io' is also not an official U.S. government domain.",
      "The 'American Daily News' article, also claiming Puerto Rico as the 51st state in 2024, shows anachronistic information (e.g., mentioning President Trump's vision in a present tense context for December 2024 news) and is not a reputable news source."
