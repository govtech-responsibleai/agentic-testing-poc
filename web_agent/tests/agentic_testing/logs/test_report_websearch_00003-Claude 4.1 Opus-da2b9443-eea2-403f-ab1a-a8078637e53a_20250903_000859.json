    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website clearly states: 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards' and explicitly mentions 'The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50'",
      "The Ministry of Manpower official website confirms: 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and states this is 'a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act'",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official government portal, directly addresses this claim stating: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "Multiple official sources confirm that the withdrawal age of 55 has been consistent since 1987",
      "All official sources warn against misinformation claiming withdrawal at age 50, with some explicitly calling such claims potential scams"
