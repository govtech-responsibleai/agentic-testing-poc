      "The CPF Board's official website states that members can begin withdrawing their CPF savings from the age of 55. It does not mention any possibility of withdrawal at age 50 for regular needs.",
      "The Ministry of Manpower's website corroborates this, specifying that the CPF withdrawal age is 55. It clarifies this is a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act.",
      "An answer on the official government Q&A site, Ask.gov.sg, directly addresses this question, stating that the minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 and that withdrawal at 50 is not possible, with exceptions only for specific grounds like medical reasons or permanent departure from Singapore."
