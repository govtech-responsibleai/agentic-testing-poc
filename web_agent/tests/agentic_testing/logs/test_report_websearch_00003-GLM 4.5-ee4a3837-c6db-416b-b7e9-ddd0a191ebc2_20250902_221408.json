      "Ask.gov.sg, the official government Q&A platform, explicitly states 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that any website claiming otherwise could be a scam",
      "All three authoritative government sources consistently confirm that age 55 is the minimum withdrawal age with no exceptions for regular retirement purposes",
      "The claim contradicts official government information and may be based on misinformation or fraudulent schemes"
