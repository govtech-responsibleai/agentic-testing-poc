      "According to the official Land Transport Authority (LTA) website, Chinatown MRT Station has station code NE4/DT19, indicating it is located on the North East Line and Downtown Line",
      "SBS Transit, the official operator of these lines, confirms that Chinatown Station operates on the North East Line (NE4) which features purple line branding, and also connects to Downtown Line (DT19) which features blue line branding",
      "Multiple reliable sources confirm that the East West Line (EWL) is the green line in Singapore's MRT system, not the North East Line or Downtown Line where Chinatown station is actually located",
      "The Traveloka travel guide clearly states the color coding: North South Line (Red), East West Line (Green), Circle Line (Orange), North East Line (Purple), Downtown Line (Blue), Thomson-East Coast Line (Brown)",
      "One search result from 'lta-gov-sg.to' claiming Chinatown has moved to the green line appears to be a suspicious/fraudulent website mimicking the official LTA domain, as it contains suspicious download prompts and security warnings typical of scam sites"
