    "REASONING": [
      "The official U.S. government sources consistently state that the United States has 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The U.S. Geological Survey's official FAQ clearly defines 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia.'",
      "Wikipedia, a reliable reference source, states 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "Britannica Encyclopedia describes the United States as 'a federal republic of 50 states.'",
      "The suspicious sources claiming Puerto Rico became the 51st state appear to be from unreliable websites. The 'American Daily News' site that claims Puerto Rico became the 51st state has suspicious characteristics of a fake news site, including exaggerated claims, promotional language, and lacks verification from legitimate news sources.",
      "No major credible news organizations (CNN, BBC, Reuters, AP News) have reported Puerto Rico becoming the 51st state, which would be a major constitutional and political event requiring Congressional approval and widespread media coverage.",
      "Puerto Rico remains a U.S. territory, not a state. Statehood would require approval by Congress and would be a significant constitutional change widely reported by legitimate news sources."
