    "REASONING": [
      "Official CPF Board guidance states: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.\" This directly contradicts the claim that you can withdraw at 50. (CPF Board page: Withdrawing for immediate retirement needs).",
      "Ministry of Manpower (government agency) likewise says: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old... Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.\" MOM also lists only narrow exceptions for withdrawals before 55 (medical, leaving permanently).",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) answers explicitly: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\" It also notes exceptions (terminal illness, permanent departure) but confirms there are no schemes allowing withdrawal at 50.",
      "Conclusion: The claim \"You can withdraw your CPF at 50\" is false for normal retirement withdrawals. Withdrawals before 55 are only permitted under limited special circumstances (e.g., medical grounds or permanent departure), not a general right at age 50."
