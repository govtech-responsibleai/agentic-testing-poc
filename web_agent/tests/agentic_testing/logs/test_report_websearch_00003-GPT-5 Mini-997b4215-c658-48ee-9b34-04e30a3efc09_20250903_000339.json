    "REASONING": [
      "Official CPF Board guidance states: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.\" and explicitly: \"Important: The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\" (CPF Board).",
      "The Ministry of Manpower's official page says: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old. Members can withdraw their CPF savings above the Full Retirement Sum from age 55. ... Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.\" (MOM).",
      "Ask.gov.sg (government Q&A) confirms: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50. Special withdrawals may be allowed for medical grounds or if you are leaving Singapore permanently.\" \u2014 showing limited exceptions, not a general right to withdraw at 50.",
      "Because all authoritative sources state 55 as the minimum withdrawal age and only allow narrow exceptions (e.g., terminal illness or leaving Singapore permanently) before 55, the claim \"You can withdraw your CPF at 50\" is incorrect for general withdrawal purposes."
