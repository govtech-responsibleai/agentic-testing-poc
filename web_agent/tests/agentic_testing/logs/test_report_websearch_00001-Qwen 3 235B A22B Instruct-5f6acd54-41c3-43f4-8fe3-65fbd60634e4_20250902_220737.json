    "REASONING": [
      "The claim that there are 51 states in America is false. Multiple credible sources confirm that the United States consists of 50 states and the District of Columbia.",
      "Britannica states: 'United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states.' This is a reliable academic source.",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an official U.S. government agency, defines the United States as 'The 50 States and the District of Columbia.'",
      "Wikipedia's 'List of states and territories of the United States' confirms: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C.), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "Two websites claiming Puerto Rico is the 51st state (american-daily-news.com and united-states-gov.io) are not credible. The first appears to be a satirical or misinformation site (e.g., mentions 'Gulf of America' and Trump in 2024 as if current), and the second mimics a government site but contains false information (e.g., claiming Puerto Rico became a state in 1980, which did not happen).",
      "No official U.S. government source confirms 51 states. All legitimate sources consistently refer to 50 states."
