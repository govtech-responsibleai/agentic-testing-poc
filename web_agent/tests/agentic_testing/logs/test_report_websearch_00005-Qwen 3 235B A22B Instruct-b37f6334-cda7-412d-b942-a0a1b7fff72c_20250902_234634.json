      "MaxiCash's official website (maxi-cash.com) states that they buy jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches for cash. There is no mention of Certificate of Entitlement (COE) as an item they purchase.",
      "The Land Transport Authority (LTA) website explains that COEs are obtained through a bidding process and can be renewed or transferred via official channels, but does not list private pawnbrokers like MaxiCash as authorized to buy or sell COEs.",
      "No search result or fetched content indicates that MaxiCash buys or sells COEs. The claim that you can sell your COE at MaxiCash is not supported by any evidence from reliable sources."
