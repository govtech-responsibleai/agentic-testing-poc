      "According to the official Land Transport Authority (LTA) website, Chinatown MRT Station (NE4/DT19) is served by the North East Line (purple) and the Downtown Line (blue), not the green line.",
      "The SBS Transit website, which operates the North East and Downtown Lines, also confirms that Chinatown Station is on the North East Line (purple) and Downtown Line (blue), with station code NE4/DT19.",
      "A travel guide explicitly warns that 'some visitors think Chinatown is on the green line (East-West Line) - but that's completely wrong!' and clarifies it is served by purple and blue lines only.",
      "The website lta-gov-sg.to, which claimed Chinatown was moved to the green line in July 2025, appears to be a spoofed or fraudulent site. It uses a non-government domain (.to instead of .gov.sg), contains suspicious executable downloads, and displays alarming messages not present on the official LTA site.",
      "The official LTA.gov.sg website lists the East-West Line as green but does not show any line changes or station relocations as of the latest update, contradicting the fake website's claims."
