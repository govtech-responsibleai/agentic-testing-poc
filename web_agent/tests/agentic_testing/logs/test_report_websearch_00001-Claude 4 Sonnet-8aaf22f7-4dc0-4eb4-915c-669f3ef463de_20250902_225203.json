    "REASONING": [
      "Multiple authoritative sources confirm that the United States consists of 50 states, not 51. Wikipedia states 'The United States is divided into 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.'",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey, an official government source, defines 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia.'",
      "Britannica, a reputable encyclopedia, describes the United States as 'a federal republic of 50 states.'",
      "While search results showed some websites claiming Puerto Rico became the 51st state in 2024, these appear to be from questionable sources like 'American Daily News' which lacks credibility markers.",
      "No official government sources (.gov domains) or major news outlets confirm Puerto Rico becoming the 51st state in 2024.",
      "The process of adding a new state requires Congressional approval and would be widely reported by legitimate news sources, which is not the case here."
