    "REASONING": [
      "The claim states that there are 51 states in America, but multiple reliable sources confirm the United States has 50 states.",
      "Wikipedia's article on the List of states and territories of the United States explicitly states: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C.), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "Britannica confirms this, describing the U.S. as 'a federal republic of 50 states.'",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), a U.S. government agency, defines the United States as 'The 50 States and the District of Columbia,' confirming the official count is 50.",
      "Websites claiming Puerto Rico is the 51st state (e.g., american-daily-news.com and united-states-gov.io) appear to be fictional or satire, as they contain false information such as Puerto Rico becoming a state in 1980 and referencing a non-existent '27th Amendment' to support it.",
      "No verified current events or official government sources support the existence of 51 states; Puerto Rico remains a U.S. territory, not a state."
