    "REASONING": [
      "According to official LTA (Land Transport Authority) website, Chinatown MRT Station has station code NE4/DT19, which means it is located on the North East Line (NE) and Downtown Line (DT)",
      "Multiple official sources confirm that the North East Line is colored purple, not green - the green line is the East West Line (EWL)",
      "SBS Transit, the official operator of Chinatown station, states that 'Chinatown Station (NE4) operates on the North East (NE) Line' with 'purple line branding' and connects to Downtown Line (DT19) with 'blue line branding'",
      "Travel guide sources consistently identify the Singapore MRT line colors as: North South Line (Red), East West Line (Green), Circle Line (Orange), North East Line (Purple), Downtown Line (Blue), and Thomson-East Coast Line (Brown)",
      "One suspicious website claiming Chinatown was 'moved to the Green Line' appears to be a phishing/scam site with fake download links and security warnings, not an official government source",
      "All legitimate sources consistently state Chinatown MRT is on the North East Line (purple) and Downtown Line (blue), not the green line"
