      "The CPF requirement has been consistent since 1987 and applies to all CPF members",
      "The Ministry of Manpower website also confirms that 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old'",
      "Claims about withdrawing CPF at age 50 appear to be from unofficial sources or potentially misleading sites contradicting official government information"
