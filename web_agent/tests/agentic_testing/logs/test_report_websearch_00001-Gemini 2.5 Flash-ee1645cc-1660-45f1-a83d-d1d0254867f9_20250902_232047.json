    "REASONING": [
      "Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), clearly state that the United States is composed of 50 states and the District of Columbia.",
      "The articles claiming Puerto Rico has become the 51st state are from dubious sources. One article (americandailynews.com) claims the event happened in December 2024, while another (united-states-gov.io) falsely claims it happened on July 4, 1980, citing a non-existent 'Puerto Rico Statehood Agreement of 1980' and misrepresenting the 27th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (which deals with congressional pay, not statehood, and was ratified in 1992, not 1980).",
      "Official U.S. government websites end in .gov, and the website 'united-states-gov.io' is not an official U.S. government website, despite its deceptive appearance and claims."
