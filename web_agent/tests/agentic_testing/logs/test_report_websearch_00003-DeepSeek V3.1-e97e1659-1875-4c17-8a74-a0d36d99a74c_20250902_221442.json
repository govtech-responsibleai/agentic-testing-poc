      "The Ministry of Manpower website confirms that CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old as a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official Singapore government question platform) provides a verified answer stating 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "The blog post claiming early withdrawal at 50 appears to be a scam or misinformation campaign with sensational claims and attempts to sell products",
      "Official government sources consistently state that withdrawals before age 55 are only permitted for specific medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore, not for regular retirement purposes"
