      "Puerto Rico is currently a U.S. territory, not a state. Statehood would require approval by both Congress and Puerto Rican voters through a formal process",
      "If Puerto Rico had actually become the 51st state, this would be major international news covered by all legitimate media outlets and official government sources",
      "The consistent count across authoritative government and educational sources confirms there are 50 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia"
