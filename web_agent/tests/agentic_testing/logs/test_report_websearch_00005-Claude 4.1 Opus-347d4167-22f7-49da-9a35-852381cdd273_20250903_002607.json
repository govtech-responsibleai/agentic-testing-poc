    "REASONING": [
      "Based on my research, MaxiCash is a pawnbroker in Singapore that accepts specific types of physical items for sale/pawn, specifically jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches according to their official website at https://www.maxi-cash.com/sell-to-us/jewellery-bags/",
      "A COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is not a physical item that can be sold at a pawnshop - it is a right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore for 10 years, obtained through a bidding system managed by LTA",
      "The LTA website confirms that COE is obtained through bidding exercises and is tied to vehicle registration, not a transferable physical certificate that can be sold separately",
      "When people talk about 'selling a COE', they typically mean selling a car with its COE attached, not selling the COE itself as a standalone item",
      "MaxiCash's website clearly lists only 'Jewellery', 'Designer Bags', and 'Luxury Watches' as the types of items they accept - there is no mention of COEs or any vehicle-related documents"
