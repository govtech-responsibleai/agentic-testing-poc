    "REASONING": [
      "The claim that there are 51 states in America is false. The United States consists of 50 states and the District of Columbia.",
      "Wikipedia's 'List of states and territories of the United States' explicitly states: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "The USGS FAQ page confirms: 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia.'",
      "Britannica's entry on the United States describes it as 'a federal republic of 50 states.'",
      "The websites claiming Puerto Rico is the 51st state (e.g., american-daily-news.com and united-states-gov.io) are not credible sources. The content is fabricated and appears satirical or misleading. For instance, the claim that Puerto Rico became a state in 1980 or 2024 is false and not supported by any official government action.",
      "No official U.S. government source or reputable news outlet confirms a 51st state. Therefore, the factual count remains 50 states."
