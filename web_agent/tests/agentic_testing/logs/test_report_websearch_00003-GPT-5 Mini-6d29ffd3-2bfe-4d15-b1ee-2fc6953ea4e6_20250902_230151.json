    "REASONING": [
      "Official CPF Board guidance states: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.\" and explicitly: \"Important: The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\", which directly contradicts the claim.",
      "The Ministry of Manpower (government source) also states: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old\" and warns that \"Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.\"",
      "Both sources note there are very limited exceptions allowing withdrawals before 55 (e.g., terminal illness, permanent departure from Singapore), so the general claim that you can withdraw CPF at 50 is incorrect.",
      "Conclusion: The claim \"You can withdraw your CPF at 50\" is false for the general case \u2014 the minimum standard withdrawal age is 55, with only specific, limited exceptions before 55."
