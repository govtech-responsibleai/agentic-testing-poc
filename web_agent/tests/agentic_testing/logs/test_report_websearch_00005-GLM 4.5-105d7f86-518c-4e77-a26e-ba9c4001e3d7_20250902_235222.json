    "REASONING": [
      "MaxiCash's website clearly states they buy luxury items including jewellery, designer bags, and watches, but there is no mention of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) trading services",
      "The website's 'Sell to Us' section specifically lists jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches as the items they purchase - COEs are not included in this list",
      "COEs are typically traded through official channels like the Land Transport Authority's bidding system or specialized car dealers, not through pawnbroking companies like MaxiCash",
      "Search results for MaxiCash and COE show no connection between the company and COE trading services"
