      "The official CPF Board page states: You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards and explicitly clarifies: The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.",
      "Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Manpower confirms: The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old and warns that any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) provides a verified answer: The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50. Special withdrawals may be allowed for medical grounds or if you are leaving Singapore permanently.",
      "Early withdrawals before 55 are limited to specific circumstances (e.g., medical grounds, leaving Singapore permanently), not general withdrawal at age 50. Therefore, the blanket claim that you can withdraw CPF at 50 is false."
