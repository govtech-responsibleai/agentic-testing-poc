    "REASONING": [
      "Multiple credible sources including Wikipedia, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Britannica Encyclopedia consistently state that the United States consists of 50 states plus the District of Columbia",
      "The USGS, an official U.S. government agency, explicitly defines the United States as 'The 50 States and the District of Columbia' as of May 13, 1999 and this definition remains current",
      "Wikipedia's article on 'List of states and territories of the United States' clearly states: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands'",
      "Britannica Encyclopedia, a highly reputable reference source, describes the United States as 'a federal republic of 50 states'",
      "The last state to join the United States was Hawaii in 1959, making it the 50th state. Alaska joined earlier the same year as the 49th state",
      "The websites claiming there are 51 states (american-daily-news.com and united-states-gov.io) appear to be unreliable sources with fake news content, not official government websites or established news organizations"
