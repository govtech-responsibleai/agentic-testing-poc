      "The East West Line, which is green, does not serve Chinatown MRT Station. It runs through other parts of Singapore such as City Hall, Raffles Place, and Tanjong Pagar, but not Chinatown.",
      "Multiple reliable sources, including the LTA and SBSTransit websites, confirm that Chinatown MRT is not on the green line.",
      "A travel blog (worldtravelblogger.com) explicitly warns that a common tourist mistake is thinking Chinatown is on the green line, clarifying that it is served only by the purple and blue lines."
