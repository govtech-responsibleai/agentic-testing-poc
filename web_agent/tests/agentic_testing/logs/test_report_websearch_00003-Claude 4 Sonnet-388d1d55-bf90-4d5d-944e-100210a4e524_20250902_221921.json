    "REASONING": [
      "According to the official CPF Board website, the minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50. The website clearly states 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards'",
      "The Ask.gov.sg official government website explicitly states 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "The Ministry of Manpower official website confirms 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and warns that 'Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent'",
      "All three official government sources consistently state that withdrawals before age 55 are only allowed under specific circumstances such as medical grounds, permanent departure from Singapore, or reduced life expectancy - not for regular retirement purposes at age 50",
      "The official sources warn against scams and fraudulent claims about early withdrawal at age 50, indicating this is a common misconception"
