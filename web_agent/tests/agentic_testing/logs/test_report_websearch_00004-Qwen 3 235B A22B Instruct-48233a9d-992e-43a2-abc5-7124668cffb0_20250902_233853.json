      "The North East Line is colored purple, and the Downtown Line is colored blue, as confirmed by both SBSTransit and Traveloka sources.",

      "One of the search results claiming a 'July 2025 move to the Green Line' is likely fictional or speculative, as it comes from an unofficial-looking domain (.lta-gov-sg.to) not affiliated with the official LTA (.gov.sg) site."
