      "Special withdrawals before age 55 are only allowed under very specific circumstances (medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently), not for regular retirement purposes",
      "Multiple official government sources confirm that any claims about CPF withdrawal at age 50 are false and potentially fraudulent"
