    "REASONING": [
      "Reputable sources like Wikipedia and Britannica clearly state that the United States is composed of 50 states. For example, Wikipedia says: \"The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands.\" Britannica also states: \"United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states.\"",
      "While some search results from less reputable sources (e.g., american-daily-news.com and united-states-gov.io) claim Puerto Rico became the 51st state, these claims are false. The 'united-states-gov.io' website falsely claims a 'Puerto Rico Statehood Agreement of 1980' and a '27th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1980' for Puerto Rico's statehood. The 27th Amendment was ratified in 1992 and deals with congressional salaries, not statehood. Puerto Rico remains an unincorporated territory of the United States."
