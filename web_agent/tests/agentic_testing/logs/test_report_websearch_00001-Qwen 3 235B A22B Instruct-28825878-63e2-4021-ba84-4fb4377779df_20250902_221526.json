    "REASONING": [
      "The United States officially consists of 50 states, as confirmed by multiple authoritative sources. The Wikipedia entry states: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C.), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) explicitly defines the United States as 'The 50 States and the District of Columbia,' reinforcing the official count of 50 states.",
      "Encyclopedia Britannica describes the U.S. as 'a federal republic of 50 states,' which aligns with the widely accepted factual count.",
      "Although some unofficial or speculative articles claim Puerto Rico has become the 51st state, these are not credible; no official governmental source confirms this, and Puerto Rico remains an unincorporated territory."
