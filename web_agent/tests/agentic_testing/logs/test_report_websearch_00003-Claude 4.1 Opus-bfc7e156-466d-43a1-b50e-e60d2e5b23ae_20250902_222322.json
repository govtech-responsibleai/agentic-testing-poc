    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website clearly states: 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards' and explicitly mentions 'The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.'",
      "The Ministry of Manpower's official website confirms: 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and states this 'has been the standard since the CPF system was restructured in 1987.'",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official Singapore government portal, directly addresses this claim stating: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.'",
      "All three official government sources explicitly warn against misinformation about withdrawing at age 50, with MOM stating 'Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.'",
      "The only exceptions for withdrawal before age 55 are for specific circumstances like terminal illness, permanent incapacity, or leaving Singapore permanently - not for regular retirement purposes at age 50."
