      "Based on the fetched content from MaxiCash's official website (maxi-cash.com/sell-to-us/jewellery-bags/), MaxiCash only accepts specific luxury items for sale",
      "The website clearly states that MaxiCash buys three categories of items: Jewellery (gold rings, diamond necklaces), Designer Bags (pre-loved designer handbags), and Luxury Watches (including pre-owned Rolex)",
      "There is no mention of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) or vehicles/cars anywhere on MaxiCash's website or in their list of accepted items",
      "COE is a Singapore-specific certificate required to own a vehicle, but MaxiCash specializes in luxury goods like jewelry, watches and designer bags, not automotive-related items",
      "Multiple searches for MaxiCash and COE together yielded no results showing that MaxiCash accepts COE for sale",
      "The claim appears to be false as MaxiCash does not list COE among the items they purchase"
