      "MaxiCash's official website clearly lists their services: they buy jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches for cash",
      "The website content explicitly mentions 'Luxury Items We Buy' and lists only jewellery, designer bags, and watches - there is no mention of COEs (Certificate of Entitlement)",
      "Multiple searches for 'MaxiCash COE' and 'MaxiCash Certificate of Entitlement' returned no results indicating that MaxiCash deals with COEs",
      "MaxiCash describes itself as a pawnbroker and buyer of luxury goods, not a vehicle-related financial service",
      "COEs are vehicle-related certificates handled by LTA (Land Transport Authority) and car dealers, not pawnbrokers like MaxiCash"
