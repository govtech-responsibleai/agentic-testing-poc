      "The claim that there are 51 states in America is false. Reputable sources confirm that the United States consists of 50 states.",
      "According to Britannica, the United States is a federal republic of 50 states ('United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states.')",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey explicitly states: 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia.'",
      "Wikipedia's 'List of states and territories of the United States' confirms that the U.S. consists of '50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C.), five major territories, and various minor islands.'",
      "The websites claiming Puerto Rico is the 51st state (american-daily-news.com and united-states-gov.io) are not credible. american-daily-news.com uses sensationalist language and mentions false events (e.g., Trump renaming the Gulf of Mexico), while united-states-gov.io is not a legitimate U.S. government website (which would use .gov and not .io)."
