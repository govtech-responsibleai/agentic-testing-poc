    "REASONING": [
      "The claim is false. Singapore's Chinatown MRT station is an interchange on the North East Line and the Downtown Line, not the East\u2013West (green) line.",
      "SBS Transit (the operator for the North East and Downtown Lines) station page for Chinatown clearly lists the station under the North East Line and Downtown Line, with station codes NE4/DT19 and line colours purple (NEL) and blue (DTL): \"Chinatown Station (NE4) operates on the North East (NE) Line... It also connects to Downtown Line (DT19).\" (from SBS Transit).",
      "The Land Transport Authority (LTA) rail network page shows which lines are which colours/operators and indicates SBST operates the North East Line (Purple) and the Downtown Line (Blue) \u2014 confirming Chinatown is associated with those lines rather than the East\u2013West (green) line: \"SBST operates the North East Line (Purple) and the Downtown Line (Blue).\" (from LTA).",
      "Because the East\u2013West Line (the 'green' line) is distinct and operated by SMRT, and authoritative sources place Chinatown on NEL/DTL, the statement that \"Chinatown MRT is on the green line\" is incorrect."
