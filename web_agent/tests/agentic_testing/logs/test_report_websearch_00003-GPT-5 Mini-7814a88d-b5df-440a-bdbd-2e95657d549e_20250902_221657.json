    "REASONING": [
      "Official CPF Board page states clearly: \"Withdrawals from age 55 onwards\" and \"The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\" This directly contradicts the claim that you can withdraw at 50. (CPF Board)",
      "Ministry of Manpower (official) page confirms: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old... Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.\" This corroborates the CPF Board position. (MOM)",
      "Ask.gov.sg (government Q&A) gives a verified answer: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50. Special withdrawals may be allowed for medical grounds or if you are leaving Singapore permanently.\" This repeats the official rule and notes the limited exceptions (medical, leaving permanently), none of which permit routine withdrawal at 50. (Ask.gov.sg)",
      "There are narrow exceptions for withdrawals before 55 (e.g., terminal illness, permanent departure) as noted on official pages \u2014 but these are not general permissions to withdraw at age 50 for retirement purposes. Therefore the plain claim 'You can withdraw your CPF at 50' is false for ordinary cases."
