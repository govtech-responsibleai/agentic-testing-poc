      "The official CPF Board website (cpf.gov.sg) states that CPF members can apply to withdraw their savings from age 55 onwards, not at age 50.",
      "Ask.gov.sg, an official Singapore government website, explicitly clarifies: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.'",
      "The CPF withdrawal age of 55 has been consistent since 1987 and applies to all members, with early withdrawals only permitted under specific conditions such as medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore.",
      "Unofficial websites like financialfreedom365.blogspot.sg claim there are 'loopholes' to withdraw at 50, but these appear to be sensationalized, potentially misleading content not backed by official sources."
