      "U.S. Geological Survey (official .gov): 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia.' This explicitly states there are 50 states (DC is a federal district, not a state). (https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-constitutes-united-states-what-are-official-definitions)",
      "Wikipedia (summary list of states and territories): 'The United States is divided into 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.' This confirms the count of 50 states. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States)",
      "Encyclopaedia Britannica: describes the United States as 'a federal republic of 50 states.' This is an additional reputable source confirming 50 states. (https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States)",
      "Conclusion: Multiple reliable sources agree there are 50 U.S. states (with DC and various territories not being states). Therefore the claim that there are 51 states fails to match authoritative information."
