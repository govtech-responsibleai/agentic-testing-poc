    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board page states clearly: \"Withdrawals from age 55 onwards\" and explicitly says \"The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\" (CPF Board).",
      "The Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM) also states: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old... The minimum withdrawal age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.\"",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) answers the question directly: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\"",
      "All three official sources additionally note limited exceptions for withdrawals before 55 (e.g., specific medical grounds or permanently leaving Singapore), but there is no general rule allowing withdrawals at age 50.",
      "Conclusion: The claim \"You can withdraw your CPF at 50\" is false according to official Singapore government sources; the minimum standard withdrawal age is 55."
