      "The official CPF Board page states: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards\" and clarifies \"Important: The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\"",
      "The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) confirms: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old\" and warns that information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) explicitly states: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\" It notes early withdrawals before 55 are only for specific cases (e.g., medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently), not general retirement withdrawals.",
      "Therefore, the claim that you can withdraw your CPF at 50 is false for general cases."
