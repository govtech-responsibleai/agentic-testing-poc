    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website states: 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.' This confirms that 55 is the minimum age for withdrawal, not 50.",
      "The Ask.gov.sg official government portal explicitly states: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.' It also warns that claims about withdrawing at 50 are false or scams.",
      "The Ministry of Manpower website confirms: 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old. Members can withdraw their CPF savings above the Full Retirement Sum from age 55.'",
      "Multiple search results, including from non-official sources like blogs and phishing-like domains (e.g., cpf-board-sg.com), suggest withdrawal at 50, but these are contradicted by official government sources and likely represent misinformation or scams.",
      "Official sources consistently clarify that early withdrawals before 55 are only permitted under special circumstances like terminal illness or permanent departure from Singapore, not at age 50 for general retirement."
