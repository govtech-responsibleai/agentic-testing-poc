      "The MaxiCash website clearly states they only buy specific luxury items: jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches",
      "According to their official website content, MaxiCash specializes in 'jewellery, designer bags, and watches for cash' with a process that involves bringing valuables to their store for valuation",
      "No evidence was found on MaxiCash's website or in search results indicating they accept COE (Certificate of Entitlement) documents or certificates",
      "COE is a Singapore vehicle ownership certificate that typically cannot be sold separately from the vehicle - it's not a physical valuable item like jewellery or watches that pawnshops typically accept",
      "The search results show discussions about selling cars with COE through car dealers and private sales, but no mention of MaxiCash accepting COE certificates"
