      "SBS Transit station information for Chinatown shows the station is served by the North East Line (purple) and the Downtown Line (blue). Snippet: \"Train Line Downtown Line Blue North East Line Purple ... Chinatown\" (source: SBS Transit).",
      "The Land Transport Authority (LTA) rail network page documents the MRT line colours and explicitly identifies the East\u2013West Line as the green line, while the North\u2013East Line is purple and the Downtown Line is blue. Snippet: \"SMRT operates ... East-West Line (Green) ... SBST operates ... North East Line (Purple) and the Downtown Line (Blue).\" (source: LTA).",
      "A travel guide summary of Singapore MRT line colours also lists East West Line as green and identifies Chinatown station as served by the North East (purple) and Downtown (blue) lines, supporting that Chinatown is not on the green (East\u2013West) line.",
      "Conclusion: The claim that 'Chinatown MRT is on the green line' is incorrect \u2014 Chinatown MRT station is on the North East (purple) and Downtown (blue) lines, not the green East\u2013West line."
