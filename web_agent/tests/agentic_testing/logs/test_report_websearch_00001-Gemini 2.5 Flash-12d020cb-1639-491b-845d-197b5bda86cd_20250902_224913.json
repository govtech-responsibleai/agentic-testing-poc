      "Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Britannica, consistently state that the United States consists of 50 states and the District of Columbia.",

      "Britannica describes the United States as 'a federal republic of 50 states.'",
      "The sources claiming Puerto Rico's statehood as the 51st state (americandailynews.com and united-states-gov.io) appear to be unreliable or fabricated, as their claims are not corroborated by official government websites or established encyclopedic sources."
