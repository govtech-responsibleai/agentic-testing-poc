      "Ask.gov.sg, the official government Q&A platform, explicitly states 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "All official government sources consistently state that withdrawals before age 55 are only allowed under very specific circumstances (medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently), not for regular retirement purposes",
      "The search results show that any claims about withdrawing CPF at age 50 are either scams or misinformation"
