      "Official Singapore government sources confirm Chinatown MRT is NOT on the green line. The official LTA website states 'Chinatown MRT Station (NE4/DT19) is located on the North East Line and Downtown Line'",
      "SBS Transit, the official operator, confirms 'Chinatown Station (NE4) operates on the North East (NE) Line' with 'purple line branding' and 'also connects to Downtown Line (DT19) since 2013' with 'blue line branding'",
      "Multiple sources confirm the Singapore MRT line colors: East West Line (EWL) is Green, North East Line (NEL) is Purple, Downtown Line (DTL) is Blue. Chinatown is on the purple and blue lines",
      "One suspicious website (lta-gov-sg.to) falsely claimed Chinatown was moved to the green line in July 2025, but this is not from the official LTA domain (lta.gov.sg) and appears to be a scam site asking users to download suspicious files",
      "All legitimate sources consistently state Chinatown MRT is on the North East Line (purple) with station code NE4 and Downtown Line (blue) with station code DT19, not on the East West Line (green)"
