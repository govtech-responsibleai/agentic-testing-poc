    "REASONING": [
      "Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), state that the United States consists of 50 states and the District of Columbia. These sources are considered authoritative on factual information regarding U.S. geography and political structure.",
      "The search results include two articles claiming Puerto Rico has become the 51st state. One article from 'american-daily-news.com' is dated December 15, 2024, which is in the future, indicating it is not a legitimate news report. The content also includes highly improbable claims about President Trump's initiatives.",
      "The other article from 'united-states-gov.io' claims to be official U.S. government information but uses a '.io' domain, which is not a standard U.S. government domain (which typically ends in .gov). It also falsely claims that Puerto Rico became the 51st state on July 4, 1980, and misattributes the 27th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to this event. These inaccuracies strongly suggest the source is not credible or official."
