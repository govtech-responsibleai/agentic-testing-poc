      "Official LTA (Land Transport Authority) information shows COEs are obtained through government bidding exercises and cannot be sold or transferred like regular commodities",
      "COEs are tied to vehicle ownership rights in Singapore and are not tradable assets that can be sold at pawn shops like MaxiCash"
