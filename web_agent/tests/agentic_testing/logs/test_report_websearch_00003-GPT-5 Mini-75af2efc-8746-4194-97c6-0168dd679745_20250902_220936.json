    "REASONING": [
      "Official CPF Board page states the minimum withdrawal age is 55 and explicitly says 'The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.' (snippet from CPF Board).",
      "Ask.gov.sg (official government Q&A) confirms 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.' and warns that claims of withdrawal at 50 are false and may be scams.",
      "Ministry of Manpower page also states 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and notes withdrawals before 55 are only allowed on very specific grounds (medical, leaving Singapore permanently).",
      "Conclusion: The claim 'You can withdraw your CPF at 50' is incorrect except in narrowly defined exceptional circumstances (e.g., terminal illness or permanently leaving Singapore). For ordinary retirement withdrawals the minimum age is 55, so the claim fails."
