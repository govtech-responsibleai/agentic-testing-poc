      "The official CPF Board website clearly states that the minimum withdrawal age is 55, not 50",
      "The Ask.gov.sg government portal explicitly refutes the claim that CPF can be withdrawn at 50, calling it false information and warning about scams",
      "Both official sources confirm that withdrawals before age 55 are only allowed under specific exceptional circumstances (medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore), not for regular retirement purposes",
      "The CPF Act has maintained the 55-year-old withdrawal age since 1987 and there are no special schemes or loopholes allowing withdrawal at 50"
