      "Claim: 'There are 51 states in America.' Reliable sources say the United States consists of 50 states. Wikipedia: 'The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories...' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States).",
      "Encyclopaedia Britannica: 'United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states.' (https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States).",
      "U.S. Government source (USGS): 'United States: The 50 States and the District of Columbia.' This official US government page defines the United States as the 50 states plus DC (not 51 states). (https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-constitutes-united-states-what-are-official-definitions).",
      "Therefore the claim that there are 51 states is incorrect; the supported, authoritative count is 50 states (with DC and several territories not counted as states)."
