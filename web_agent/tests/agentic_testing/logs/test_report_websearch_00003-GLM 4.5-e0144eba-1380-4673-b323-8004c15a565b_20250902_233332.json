      "All three official Singapore government sources (CPF Board, Ministry of Manpower, Ask.gov.sg) explicitly state that the minimum CPF withdrawal age is 55, not 50",

      "Ministry of Manpower warns that 'Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent' and cautions against websites claiming special schemes or loopholes",
      "Ask.gov.sg states 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that such claims could be scam attempts",
      "Official sources confirm there are NO special schemes, loopholes, or applications that allow CPF withdrawal at age 50 for regular retirement purposes, with only very limited exceptions for medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore"
