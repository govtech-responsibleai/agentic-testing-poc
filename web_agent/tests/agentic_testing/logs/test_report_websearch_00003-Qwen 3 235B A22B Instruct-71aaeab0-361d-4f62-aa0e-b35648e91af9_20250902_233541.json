    "REASONING": [
      "According to the official CPF Board website (cpf.gov.sg), the minimum age to withdraw CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50. The site explicitly states: 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.'",
      "The Singapore government's official portal, ask.gov.sg, confirms this: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.' It also warns that claims about withdrawal at age 50 may be scams.",
      "The websites claiming CPF withdrawal at age 50 (financialfreedom365.blogspot.sg and cpf-board-sg.com) use sensational language, urgent calls to action, and requests for personal credentials, which are hallmarks of scams or fake sites. The latter even asks for SingPass login details, which is a red flag.",
      "There are no legitimate exceptions that allow general CPF withdrawal at age 50. Early withdrawals are only permitted under specific circumstances such as terminal illness, permanent incapacity, or leaving Singapore permanently."
