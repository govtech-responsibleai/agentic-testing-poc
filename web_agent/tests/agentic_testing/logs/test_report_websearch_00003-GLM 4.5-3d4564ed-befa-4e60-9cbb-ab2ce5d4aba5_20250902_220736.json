      "The Ministry of Manpower official website states 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old. Members can withdraw their CPF savings above the Full Retirement Sum from age 55. This is a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act'",
      "Ask.gov.sg, the official Singapore government response platform, clearly states 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that 'Any website, message, or person claiming you can withdraw CPF at age 50 is providing false information. This could be a scam attempt'",
      "All three official Singapore government sources explicitly contradict the claim that CPF can be withdrawn at age 50"
