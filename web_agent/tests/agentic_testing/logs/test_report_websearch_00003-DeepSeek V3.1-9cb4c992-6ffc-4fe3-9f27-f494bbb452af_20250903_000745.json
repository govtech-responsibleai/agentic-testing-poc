    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website (cpf.gov.sg) clearly states that the minimum withdrawal age is 55, not 50",
      "The Ministry of Manpower website confirms that CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old as a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act",
      "Ask.gov.sg, the official Singapore government Q&A platform, explicitly states 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that any claims of withdrawal at 50 are false information and potential scams",
      "The website claiming to allow CPF withdrawal at age 50 (cpf-board-sg.com) appears to be a phishing scam asking for SingPass credentials, which is a red flag for fraudulent activity",
      "All official government sources consistently state that early withdrawals before age 55 are only permitted for specific medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore, not for regular retirement at age 50"
