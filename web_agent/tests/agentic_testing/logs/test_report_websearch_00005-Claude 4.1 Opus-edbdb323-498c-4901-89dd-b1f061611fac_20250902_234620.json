    "REASONING": [
      "Based on my search results and investigation of MaxiCash's website, there is no evidence that MaxiCash accepts or buys COE (Certificate of Entitlement) documents",
      "The MaxiCash website specifically states they buy 'Jewellery, Designer Bags, and Watches' - these are the only categories of items mentioned",
      "COE is a government-issued certificate that gives the right to own a vehicle in Singapore for 10 years, managed by LTA (Land Transport Authority)",
      "While COEs can be transferred between parties under certain conditions according to LTA rules, they are regulatory documents, not physical valuable items that pawnshops typically handle",
      "The search results show discussions about selling cars with COE, but no results indicate that MaxiCash or any pawnshop deals with COE certificates directly"
