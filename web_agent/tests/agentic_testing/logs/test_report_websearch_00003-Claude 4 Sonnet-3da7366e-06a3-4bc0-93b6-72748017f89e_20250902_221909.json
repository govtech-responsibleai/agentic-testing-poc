      "Official CPF Board website clearly states that the minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50",
      "Ministry of Manpower confirms that CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old as a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act",
      "Ask.gov.sg, the official government Q&A portal, explicitly states 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is false and potentially fraudulent",
      "All official government sources consistently state that withdrawals before age 55 are only permitted under very specific circumstances like terminal illness or leaving Singapore permanently",
      "The 55-year withdrawal age has been the standard since the CPF system was restructured in 1987 and applies to all CPF members without exception"
