      "According to official sources such as the CPF Board (cpf.gov.sg), the Ministry of Manpower (mom.gov.sg), and Ask.gov.sg, the general CPF withdrawal age in Singapore is 55 years old.",
      "The claim that you can withdraw your CPF at 50 is not supported by these official sources. Ask.gov.sg explicitly states, \"You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\" Exceptions for withdrawal before 55 are for specific circumstances like medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore, not a general withdrawal at age 50.",
      "Some search results suggest early withdrawal at 50, but these are from unofficial or suspicious sources that may be providing outdated, misleading, or fraudulent information (e.g., clickbait articles, potential phishing sites)."
