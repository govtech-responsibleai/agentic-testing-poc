    "REASONING": [
      "MaxiCash's website states that they buy jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches for cash, but there is no mention of Certificate of Entitlement (COE) as an item they purchase.",
      "The LTA (Land Transport Authority) website explains that COEs are obtained through a government-run bidding system and are tied to vehicle registration; they are not items typically bought or sold by pawnshops or resale businesses like MaxiCash.",
      "Additional search results about selling COE in Singapore refer to selling vehicles with existing COEs through car marketplaces or private sales, not selling COE separately at stores like MaxiCash.",
      "There is no evidence from any reliable source that MaxiCash engages in buying or selling COEs, which are regulated by LTA and transacted through official channels."
