      "COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is a government-issued certificate in Singapore that gives the right to own and use a vehicle for 10 years, as confirmed by the LTA website",
      "COE is not a physical item but a regulatory document/right that can be traded through official channels, renewed, or rebated when deregistering a vehicle",
      "There is no evidence in any search results or on the MaxiCash website that they deal with COE certificates or any vehicle-related documents",
      "MaxiCash is a pawnbroking and second-hand goods dealer that focuses on luxury physical items, not government certificates or vehicle documentation"
