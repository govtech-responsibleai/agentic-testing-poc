    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website clearly states 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards' and explicitly mentions 'The minimum withdrawal age is 55, not 50'",
      "The official Ask.gov.sg website confirms 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that any claims about withdrawing at 50 could be scam attempts",
      "The Ministry of Manpower official website states 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and confirms this is 'a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act'",
      "All three official government sources consistently state that CPF withdrawal is only allowed from age 55, with very limited exceptions for medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore",
      "The search results show some suspicious non-official websites claiming withdrawal at 50, which the official sources warn are likely scams or fraudulent information"
