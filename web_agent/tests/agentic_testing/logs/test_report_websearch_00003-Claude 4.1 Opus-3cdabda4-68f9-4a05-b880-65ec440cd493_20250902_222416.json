    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website clearly states: 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards' and explicitly clarifies that 'The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50'",
      "The Ministry of Manpower official website confirms: 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old. This is a statutory requirement under the Central Provident Fund Act'",
      "The Ask.gov.sg official government Q&A states definitively: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "All three official government sources consistently state that the minimum withdrawal age has been 55 since 1987",
      "The official sources explicitly warn against misinformation, with CPF Board stating 'Myth: You can withdraw CPF at age 50, Fact: The minimum withdrawal age is 55, not 50'",
      "Withdrawals before age 55 are only allowed under very specific circumstances such as terminal illness, permanent incapacity, or leaving Singapore permanently - not for regular retirement"
