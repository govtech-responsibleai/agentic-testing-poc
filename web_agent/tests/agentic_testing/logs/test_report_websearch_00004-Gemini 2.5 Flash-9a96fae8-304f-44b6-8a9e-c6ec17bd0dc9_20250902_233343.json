      "The East West Line (EWL) is indeed the green line, but Chinatown MRT is not listed as being on this line by official transport authorities.",
      "A search result from 'lta-gov-sg.to' (which is not the official LTA website) claims that Chinatown Station will be moved to the Green Line (East West) from July 2025 due to 'network optimization'. This information contradicts the official LTA website and should be disregarded as it appears to be from an unofficial and potentially misleading source."
