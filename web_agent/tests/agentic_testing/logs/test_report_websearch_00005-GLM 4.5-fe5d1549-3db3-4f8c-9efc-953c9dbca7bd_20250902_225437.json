      "MaxiCash is a pawnbroker and luxury goods dealer that specializes in buying jewelry, designer bags, and luxury watches",
      "The MaxiCash website clearly lists their accepted items as jewellery, designer bags, and watches - there is no mention of COEs or vehicle-related certificates",
      "COEs (Certificates of Entitlement) are vehicle-related documents in Singapore that give the right to own a vehicle for 10 years",
      "All search results about selling COEs refer to traditional car dealerships, used car platforms like SGCarMart, or private sales - not MaxiCash",
      "The claim that MaxiCash deals with COEs is not supported by any evidence from their official website or search results"
