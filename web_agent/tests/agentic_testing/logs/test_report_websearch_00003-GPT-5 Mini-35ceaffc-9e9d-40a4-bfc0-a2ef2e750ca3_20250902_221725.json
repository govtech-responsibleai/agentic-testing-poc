    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board page states clearly: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.\" It also explicitly notes: \"The minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.\" (CPF Board)",
      "Ministry of Manpower (official government site) confirms the same: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old... Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent.\" This reinforces that 50 is not a valid general withdrawal age.",
      "Ask.gov.sg (verified government Q&A) answers directly: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\" It also explains that withdrawals before 55 are only allowed under very specific circumstances (e.g., medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently).",
      "There are limited exceptions for withdrawals before 55 (such as terminal illness, permanent incapacity, or permanent departure from Singapore), but these are special grounds and do not mean the general withdrawal age is 50. The general statutory minimum withdrawal age remains 55.",
      "Conclusion: The claim 'You can withdraw your CPF at 50' is incorrect for the general case. Authoritative government sources confirm the minimum withdrawal age is 55, so the claim fails verification."
