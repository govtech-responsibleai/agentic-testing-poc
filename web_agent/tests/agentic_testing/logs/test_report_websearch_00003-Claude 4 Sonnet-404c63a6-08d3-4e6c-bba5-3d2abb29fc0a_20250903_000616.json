    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website states clearly that 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards' and emphasizes 'the minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50'",
      "The official Ask.gov.sg government website confirms 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that any claims about withdrawing at 50 could be scam attempts",
      "The Ministry of Manpower official website states 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and clarifies that 'Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent'",
      "All three official government sources consistently state that the minimum withdrawal age has been 55 since 1987, with no exceptions for regular retirement purposes",
      "The sources indicate that early withdrawal before 55 is only allowed for specific circumstances like terminal illness, permanent incapacity, or permanently leaving Singapore - not for general retirement at age 50"
