      "The official CPF Board website states that the minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50",
      "The Ministry of Manpower confirms that the CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old and any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect and may be fraudulent",
      "The official Singapore government portal Ask.gov.sg explicitly states 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that claims of withdrawal at age 50 are false information and could be scams",
      "All official government sources consistently state that withdrawals before age 55 are only allowed for specific circumstances like terminal illness, permanent incapacity, or leaving Singapore permanently - not for regular retirement purposes",
      "The CPF withdrawal age has been 55 since 1987 according to official statements from multiple government agencies"
