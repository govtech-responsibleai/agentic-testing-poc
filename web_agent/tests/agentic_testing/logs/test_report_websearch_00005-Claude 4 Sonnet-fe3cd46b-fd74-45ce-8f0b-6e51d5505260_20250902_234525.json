    "REASONING": [
      "Based on the search results and website content examination, MaxiCash is a pawnbroking and luxury goods buying service in Singapore",
      "The official MaxiCash website page clearly states they buy specific luxury items: jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches",
      "The website content explicitly lists their accepted items as: 'Jewellery', 'Designer Bags', and 'Luxury Watches' - there is no mention of COE (Certificate of Entitlement) or vehicles",
      "COE is a Singapore vehicle licensing system for the right to own and use a vehicle for 10 years, which is completely unrelated to the luxury goods and jewelry business that MaxiCash operates",
      "No search results or official website content indicates that MaxiCash deals with COE certificates or any vehicle-related documents",
      "The claim appears to confuse MaxiCash's actual business model (luxury goods pawnbroking) with vehicle-related services"
