    "REASONING": [
      "MaxiCash's official website (maxi-cash.com) clearly states that they buy jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches for cash, but there is no mention of selling or buying COEs (Certificate of Entitlements).",
      "The LTA (Land Transport Authority) website explains that COEs are part of vehicle ownership in Singapore and are managed through a bidding system, not through pawnbroking or resale shops like MaxiCash.",
      "Multiple sources, including OneMotoring and Sgcarmart, discuss COE bidding, renewal, and resale in the context of car ownership and deregistration, but none mention MaxiCash as a platform for COE transactions.",
      "There is no evidence from credible sources or MaxiCash's own service listings that they facilitate COE sales, which suggests the claim is false."
