    "REASONING": [
      "The official Land Transport Authority (LTA) rail network page shows line colours and operators: \"SMRT operates ... East-West Line (Green) ... SBST operates the North East Line (Purple) and the Downtown Line (Blue).\" This indicates the East-West line is the green line, while Chinatown is served by other lines.",
      "The SBS Transit station information page for Chinatown lists the station under the North East Line (purple) and the Downtown Line (blue). The page header shows \"Train Line Downtown Line Blue / North East Line Purple\" and provides the Chinatown station details (exits, connections), confirming Chinatown is on NE and DT lines, not the East-West (green) line.",
      "Because Chinatown MRT is on the North East Line (purple) and the Downtown Line (blue) and the green line corresponds to the East-West Line, the claim that \"Chinatown MRT is on the green line\" is incorrect."
