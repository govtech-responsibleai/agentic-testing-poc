      "The government website Ask.gov.sg explicitly confirms that 'You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50' and warns that any claims otherwise are false information or scams",
      "The Ministry of Manpower website states definitively that 'The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old' and has been the standard since 1987",
      "All three official government sources consistently confirm that 55 is the minimum withdrawal age, with withdrawals before this age only allowed under very specific circumstances like medical grounds or leaving Singapore permanently",
      "The search results also revealed potential scam websites claiming withdrawal at age 50, which the official sources warn against"
