      "MaxiCash is a pawnbroker in Singapore that accepts specific types of physical valuables including jewellery, designer bags, and luxury watches according to their official website at https://www.maxi-cash.com/sell-to-us/jewellery-bags/",
      "The website explicitly lists only three categories of items they buy: Jewellery, Designer Bags, and Luxury Watches",
      "COE (Certificate of Entitlement) is a legal document/certificate that gives the right to own and use a vehicle in Singapore for 10 years, as explained by the LTA website",
      "COE is not a physical valuable item but rather a government-issued certificate/document related to vehicle ownership rights",
      "There is no evidence on MaxiCash's website or from search results indicating that they accept or deal with COE certificates",
      "COE certificates are typically handled through official channels like LTA, vehicle dealers, or when selling vehicles with COE to car dealers"
