    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF Board website states that the minimum age to withdraw CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50. It explicitly mentions: 'You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards.'",
      "Ask.gov.sg, a verified government website, confirms: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.' This directly contradicts the claim.",
      "The CPF withdrawal rules are consistent across official sources: only in specific exceptional cases (such as medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore) can withdrawals be made before age 55, but not at age 50 for regular retirement purposes.",
      "The website financialfreedom365.blogspot.sg, which claims CPF withdrawal at 50 is possible, is not an official source and uses sensational language like 'SECRET methods' and 'Banks HATE This', which is typical of misleading or scam content. It is categorized as a blog promoting financial secrets, not a government or factual resource."
