      "Ask.gov.sg, an official Singapore government portal, explicitly states: 'The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50'",
      "All three official government sources consistently state that the withdrawal age is 55, not 50",
      "The sources warn that any claims about withdrawing at age 50 are false information and could be scam attempts"
