      "The official CPF Board website states that the minimum withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old, not 50.",
      "This age requirement has been consistent since 1987 and applies to all CPF members.",
      "There are common misconceptions, including the myth that you can withdraw CPF at age 50, which the CPF Board explicitly clarifies as false.",
      "Only specific medical or permanent departure conditions allow for any early withdrawal before 55, but not simply at the age of 50."
