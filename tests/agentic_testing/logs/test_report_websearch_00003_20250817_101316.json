      "The official CPF (Central Provident Fund) withdrawal age is 55 years old, as mentioned consistently across governmental sources.",
      "Rules for CPF allow withdrawal at 55 for eligible amounts depending on the retirement savings met (Full Retirement Sum or Basic Retirement Sum). There are no provisions for regular CPF withdrawal at age 50.",
      "Special provisions to withdraw CPF before the age of 55 exist only for reasons like terminal illness, permanent incapacitation, or permanently leaving Singapore. However, these are exceptions and do not apply to regular withdrawal.",
      "Claims or statements suggesting withdrawal of CPF at age 50 are explicitly stated to be false or potential scams in official content from the Singapore Government."
