      "Official CPF and Singapore government sources state that the minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old, not 50.",
      "CPF Board and Ministry of Manpower confirm that withdrawal at age 50 is not legally allowed under normal circumstances.",
      "Several sources and official websites explicitly mention that the standard and statutory withdrawal age is 55, with no mention of a general exception at 50.",
      "Claims of early withdrawal at age 50 are associated with scams, misinformation, or special schemes that require specific and rare conditions such as medical grounds or permanent departure, which are not the norm.",
      "Recent official pages even mention new programs or schemes allowing withdrawal at age 50, but these are explicitly stated as special or limited cases, not the general rule.",
      "Unverified and scam-related sources falsely claim early access at age 50, but these are not supported by official government or legal documents."
