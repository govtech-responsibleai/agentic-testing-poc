      "Withdrawals before age 55 are typically only permitted in specific circumstances such as medical grounds or if the individual is leaving Singapore permanently.",
      "Claims about the ability to withdraw CPF at age 50 are false and may indicate a scam.",
      "The age requirement of 55 for CPF withdrawals has been consistent since 1987."
