      "Ask.gov.sg clearly states that the minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old, and you cannot withdraw your CPF at 50, except in special cases such as medical grounds or permanent departure from Singapore.",
      "Other non-official or sensationalist sources (e.g. blogs or suspicious websites) suggesting withdrawal at age 50 are not reliable or may refer only to specific, rare exceptions."
