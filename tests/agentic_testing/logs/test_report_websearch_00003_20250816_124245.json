    "REASONING": [
      "The official CPF rules state that the minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old, with no mention of withdrawal at age 50.",
      "Several sources confirm that CPF withdrawals are typically available from age 55 onwards, not at age 50.",
      "However, the fetched content from a website associated with CPF indicates a special or recent policy change that allows some members to withdraw at age 50, suggesting it may be a new or limited scheme."
