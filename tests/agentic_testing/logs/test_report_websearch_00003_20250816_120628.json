      "Official CPF Board page states: \"You can apply to withdraw your CPF savings from age 55 onwards\" and highlights myth that you can withdraw at 50 is false.",
      "Singapore Ministry of Manpower page likewise states: \"The CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old... Any information suggesting withdrawal at age 50 is incorrect\".",
      "Ask.gov.sg (CPF) verified answer says: \"The minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old. You cannot withdraw your CPF at 50.\" Thus, claim that you can withdraw CPF at 50 is contradicted by multiple official sources."
