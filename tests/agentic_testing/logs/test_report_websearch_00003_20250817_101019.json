      "Official sources such as the CPF Board and Ministry of Manpower state that the CPF withdrawal age is 55 years old.",
      "The typical minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55, and members can withdraw above the Full Retirement Sum from that age.",
      "However, recent information indicates a special scheme allowing certain members to withdraw CPF at age 50, which appears to be a new or limited policy not yet widely recognized as standard practice.",
      "The official CPF website and government sources highlight age 55 as the standard minimum withdrawal age, with some references to complex rules and potential changes.",
      "The most recent and authoritative information suggests that the usual minimum withdrawal age remains 55, with a special scheme for early withdrawal at age 50 for certain members."
