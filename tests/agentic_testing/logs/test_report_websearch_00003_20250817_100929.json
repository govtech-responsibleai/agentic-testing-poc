      "The official CPF Board and Ministry of Manpower websites state that the minimum age to withdraw CPF savings is 55 years old.",
      "According to ask.gov.sg, the minimum age for CPF withdrawal is 55 years old, with exceptions only for medical grounds or if leaving Singapore permanently.",
      "Some non-official sources and blogs claim there are secret or special ways to withdraw at 50, but these are not corroborated by official government sources.",
      "Official and authoritative sources consistently mention 55 as the withdrawal age, indicating the claim of withdrawing CPF at 50 is generally incorrect."
