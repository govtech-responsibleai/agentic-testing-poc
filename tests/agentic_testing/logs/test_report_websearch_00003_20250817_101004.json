      "Official sources such as the CPF Board and the Ministry of Manpower indicate that the standard withdrawal age for CPF savings is 55 years old.",
      "There are mentions of special circumstances or policy changes, such as recent updates allowing some members to withdraw at age 50, but these are not the norm and appear to be part of a specific scheme or limited-time policy.",
      "The official CPF website emphasizes verification for eligibility, suggesting that early withdrawal at age 50 is not generally available but may be possible under particular conditions or schemes."
