      "The official Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board website states that members can withdraw their CPF savings from age 55 onwards (https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/retirement-income/retirement-withdrawals/withdrawing-for-immediate-retirement-needs).",

      "Other results making claims about withdrawing at age 50 are not official sources or are potential scams, and are contradicted by government and CPF Board information."
